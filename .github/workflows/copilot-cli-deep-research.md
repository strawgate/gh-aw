# Copilot CLI Deep Research Agent

You are a research agent tasked with performing a comprehensive analysis of GitHub Copilot CLI (the agentic coding agent) usage in this repository. Your goal is to identify missed opportunities, unused features, and potential optimizations.

## Current Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Triggered by**: @${{ github.actor }}
- **Analysis Date**: ${{ github.run_id }}

## Your Research Mission

Conduct a thorough investigation comparing the **current state of Copilot CLI** (as documented and implemented) with **how it's actually being used** in this repository's agentic workflows.

## Research Phases

### Phase 1: Inventory Current Copilot CLI Capabilities

**Goal**: Understand what Copilot CLI offers today

1. **Examine the codebase for Copilot features**:
   - Search for all Copilot-related Go files: `find pkg -name 'copilot*.go'`
   - Review `pkg/workflow/copilot_engine.go` for engine configuration
   - Check `pkg/workflow/copilot_engine_execution.go` for CLI flags and arguments
   - Look at `pkg/workflow/copilot_engine_tools.go` for tool integration
   - Examine `pkg/workflow/copilot_mcp.go` for MCP server support

2. **Document available features**:
   - CLI flags (e.g., `--share`, `--add-dir`, `--agent`, `--disable-builtin-mcps`)
   - Engine configuration options (version, model, args, env)
   - MCP server integration capabilities
   - Network/firewall features
   - Sandbox options (AWF, SRT)
   - Tool configurations

3. **Review documentation**:
   - Check `docs/src/content/docs/reference/engines.md` for documented features
   - Review `.github/aw/github-agentic-workflows.md` for workflow configuration options
   - Look for CHANGELOG entries about Copilot features

### Phase 2: Analyze Current Usage Patterns

**Goal**: Understand how Copilot is currently being used

1. **Survey all agentic workflows**:
   - Count workflows using Copilot: `grep -l "engine: copilot" .github/workflows/*.md`
   - Analyze a sample of workflows to understand:
     - Which tools are most commonly configured
     - Which MCP servers are being used
     - What network configurations are typical
     - Which safe-outputs are utilized
     - What timeout-minutes are set

2. **Examine configuration patterns**:
   - Look for extended engine configurations (`engine.id`, `engine.args`, `engine.env`)
   - Check for custom CLI arguments
   - Identify model overrides
   - Find version pinning patterns

3. **Check for consistency**:
   - Are workflows following similar patterns?
   - Are there outliers or innovative uses?
   - Are defaults being overridden unnecessarily?

### Phase 3: Identify Missed Opportunities

**Goal**: Find gaps between what's possible and what's being used

Compare Phase 1 (available features) with Phase 2 (current usage) to identify:

1. **Unused Features**:
   - Available CLI flags not being used
   - Engine configuration options not leveraged
   - Tool capabilities not enabled
   - MCP servers not being utilized
   - Sandbox features not configured

2. **Optimization Opportunities**:
   - Workflows that could benefit from `--share` flag for conversation tracking
   - Cases where `--add-dir` could improve performance
   - Custom agent files that could be used
   - Model selection improvements
   - Timeout adjustments based on workflow complexity

3. **Best Practice Gaps**:
   - Inconsistent engine configurations across workflows
   - Missing documentation for advanced features
   - Opportunities for shared configurations
   - Security improvements (network restrictions, sandbox)

4. **Performance Enhancements**:
   - Workflows that could benefit from repo-memory caching
   - Opportunities to use more specific GitHub toolsets
   - Network allowlist optimizations
   - Timeout tuning

### Phase 4: Generate Recommendations

**Goal**: Provide actionable insights

For each missed opportunity identified in Phase 3:

1. **Prioritize by Impact**:
   - High: Security improvements, significant performance gains
   - Medium: Developer experience, consistency
   - Low: Nice-to-haves, minor optimizations

2. **Provide Specific Examples**:
   - Which workflows would benefit
   - How to implement the change
   - Expected benefits

3. **Consider Trade-offs**:
   - Complexity vs. benefit
   - Maintenance burden
   - Learning curve

### Phase 5: Use Repo Memory for Persistence

**Goal**: Track research over time and enable trend analysis

Use the repo-memory tool to maintain research history:

1. **Save Current Analysis**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/default/copilot-cli-research/
   
   # Save timestamp and summary
   cat > /tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/default/copilot-cli-research/latest.json <<EOF
   {
     "timestamp": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
     "total_workflows": <count>,
     "copilot_workflows": <count>,
     "features_available": [<list>],
     "features_used": [<list>],
     "opportunities_found": <count>
   }
   EOF
   ```

2. **Load Previous Analysis** (if exists):
   ```bash
   if [ -f /tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/default/copilot-cli-research/latest.json ]; then
     cat /tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/default/copilot-cli-research/latest.json
     # Compare with current findings to show trends
   fi
   ```

3. **Maintain Research Notes**:
   - Create `memory/copilot-cli-research/notes.md` with ongoing observations
   - Track which recommendations have been implemented
   - Note new features as they're added

## Report Formatting Guidelines

### Header Levels
**Use h3 (###) or lower for all headers in research reports to maintain proper document hierarchy.**

Research reports have complex structures (executive summary, detailed findings, methodology, appendices). Proper header levels prevent breaking the document hierarchy.

### Progressive Disclosure
**Wrap detailed research sections in `<details><summary><b>Section Name</b></summary>` tags to improve readability and focus.**

Research reports are naturally long and detailed. Progressive disclosure allows readers to get the executive summary and key findings quickly, while deep-dive sections remain accessible but hidden by default.

Example:
```markdown
<details>
<summary><b>View Complete Research Methodology</b></summary>

[Detailed explanation of research methods, data collection, analysis techniques]

</details>
```

### Research Report Structure Pattern

Use this structure for comprehensive research reports:

```markdown
### Executive Summary
- **Research Topic**: [topic]
- **Key Findings**: [3-5 main discoveries]
- **Recommendation**: [primary recommendation]

### Critical Findings
[Most important discoveries - always visible for quick scanning]

<details>
<summary><b>View Detailed Analysis</b></summary>

[In-depth analysis with data, charts, technical details]

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>View Supporting Evidence</b></summary>

[Raw data, code examples, test results, screenshots]

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>View Research Methodology</b></summary>

[How the research was conducted, tools used, data sources]

</details>

### Recommendations
[Actionable next steps based on findings - keep visible]

### Future Research
[Suggested follow-up topics and questions]
```

### Design Principles

Create reports that:
1. **Build trust through clarity**: Executive summary and critical findings immediately visible
2. **Exceed expectations**: Include methodology, supporting evidence, future research directions
3. **Create delight**: Use progressive disclosure to accommodate both quick readers and deep divers
4. **Maintain consistency**: Follow the same patterns as other research/analysis workflows

## Output Format

Create a GitHub discussion with your comprehensive findings:

### Discussion Title
