# Smoke Test: Copilot Engine Validation (ARM64)

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

**PURPOSE**: This smoke test validates that the Copilot engine, AWF firewall, MCP servers, and safe outputs work correctly on Linux ARM64 (ubuntu-24.04-arm) runners. This is critical for ensuring multi-architecture support.

## Test Requirements

1. **Architecture Verification**: Run `uname -m` to confirm you are running on an ARM64 (aarch64) host. Report the architecture.
2. **GitHub MCP Testing**: Review the last 2 merged pull requests in ${{ github.repository }}
3. **MCP Scripts GH CLI Testing**: Use the `mcpscripts-gh` tool to query 2 pull requests from ${{ github.repository }} (use args: "pr list --repo ${{ github.repository }} --limit 2 --json number,title,author")
4. **Serena MCP Testing**:
   - Use the Serena MCP server tool `activate_project` to initialize the workspace at `${{ github.workspace }}` and verify it succeeds (do NOT use bash to run go commands - use Serena's MCP tools)
   - After initialization, use the `find_symbol` tool to search for symbols (find which tool to call) and verify that at least 3 symbols are found in the results
5. **Playwright Testing**: Use the playwright tools to navigate to <https://github.com> and verify the page title contains "GitHub" (do NOT try to install playwright - use the provided MCP tools)
6. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-copilot-arm-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Copilot ARM64 at $(date)" (create the directory if it doesn't exist)
7. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)
8. **Discussion Interaction Testing**:
   - Use the `github-discussion-query` mcp-script tool with params: `limit=1, jq=".[0]"` to get the latest discussion from ${{ github.repository }}
   - Extract the discussion number from the result (e.g., if the result is `{"number": 123, "title": "...", ...}`, extract 123)
   - Use the `add_comment` tool with `discussion_number: <extracted_number>` to add a fun, playful comment stating that the ARM64 smoke test agent was here
9. **Build gh-aw**: Run `GOCACHE=/tmp/go-cache GOMODCACHE=/tmp/go-mod make build` to verify the agent can successfully build the gh-aw project on ARM64 (both caches must be set to /tmp because the default cache locations are not writable). If the command fails, mark this test as ❌ and report the failure.
10. **Discussion Creation Testing**: Use the `create_discussion` safe-output tool to create a discussion in the announcements category titled "copilot-arm64 was here" with the label "ai-generated"
11. **Workflow Dispatch Testing**: Use the `dispatch_workflow` safe output tool to trigger the `haiku-printer` workflow with a haiku as the message input. Create an original, creative haiku about ARM64 or multi-architecture computing.
12. **PR Review Testing**: Review the diff of the current pull request. Leave 1-2 inline `create_pull_request_review_comment` comments on specific lines, then call `submit_pull_request_review` with a brief body summarizing your review and event `COMMENT`.

## Output

1. **Create an issue** with a summary of the smoke test run:
   - Title: "Smoke Test: Copilot ARM64 - ${{ github.run_id }}"
   - Body should include:
     - Host architecture (aarch64)
     - Test results (✅ or ❌ for each test)
     - Overall status: PASS or FAIL
     - Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
     - Timestamp
     - Pull request author and assignees

2. Add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the current pull request with:
   - Architecture confirmation (ARM64/aarch64)
   - PR titles only (no descriptions)
   - ✅ or ❌ for each test result
   - Overall status: PASS or FAIL
   - Mention the pull request author and any assignees

3. Use the `add_comment` tool to add a **fun and creative comment** to the latest discussion (using the `discussion_number` you extracted in step 8) - be playful and entertaining in your comment

4. Use the `send_slack_message` tool to send a brief summary message (e.g., "ARM64 smoke test ${{ github.run_id }}: All tests passed! ✅")

If all tests pass:
- Use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label `smoke-copilot-arm` to the pull request
- Use the `remove_labels` safe-output tool to remove the label `smoke` from the pull request

**Important**: If no action is needed after completing your analysis, you **MUST** call the `noop` safe-output tool with a brief explanation. Failing to call any safe-output tool is the most common cause of safe-output workflow failures.

```json
{"noop": {"message": "No action needed: [brief explanation of what was analyzed and why]"}}
```
