# Daily Team Status

Create an upbeat daily status report for the team as a GitHub issue.

## What to include

- Recent repository activity (issues, PRs, releases, code changes)
- Team productivity suggestions and improvement ideas
- Community engagement highlights
- Project investment and feature recommendations

## Style

- Be positive, encouraging, and helpful 🌟
- Use emojis moderately for engagement
- Keep it concise - adjust length based on actual activity

## Report Formatting Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Follow these formatting guidelines to create well-structured, readable reports:

### 1. Header Levels
**Use h3 (###) or lower for all headers in your report to maintain proper document hierarchy.**

The issue title serves as h1, so all content headers should start at h3:
- Use `###` for main sections (e.g., "### Team Status Overview", "### Key Achievements")
- Use `####` for subsections (e.g., "#### Community Highlights", "#### Productivity Insights")
- Never use `##` (h2) or `#` (h1) in the report body

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
**Wrap long sections in `<details><summary><b>Section Name</b></summary>` tags to improve readability and reduce scrolling.**

Use collapsible sections for:
- Individual contributor details
- Detailed team member activity logs
- Verbose statistics and metrics
- Extended project recommendations

Example:
```markdown
<details>
<summary><b>Detailed Team Activity</b></summary>

[Long team member details...]

</details>
```

### 3. Report Structure Pattern

Your report should follow this structure for optimal readability:

1. **Team Status Overview** (always visible): Brief summary of overall team health and activity
2. **Key Achievements and Blockers** (always visible): Most important highlights and concerns
3. **Individual Contributor Details** (in `<details>` tags): Per-person activity breakdowns
4. **Action Items and Priorities** (always visible): Actionable suggestions and next steps

### Design Principles

Create reports that:
- **Build trust through clarity**: Most important info (status, achievements, blockers) immediately visible
- **Exceed expectations**: Add helpful context, trends, and comparisons to previous periods
- **Create delight**: Use progressive disclosure to reduce overwhelm while keeping details accessible
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow the same patterns as other reporting workflows

## Process

1. Gather recent activity from the repository
2. Create a new GitHub issue with your findings and insights
