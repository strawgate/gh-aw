# Smoke Test: Project Operations Validation

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Test Requirements

1. **Project Operations Testing**: Use project-related safe-output tools to validate multiple project features against the real project configured in the frontmatter. Steps:

   a. **Draft Issue Creation**: Call `update_project` with:
      - `project`: "https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/146"
      - `content_type`: "draft_issue"
      - `draft_title`: "Smoke Test Draft Issue - Run ${{ github.run_id }}"
      - `draft_body`: "Test draft issue for smoke test validation"
      - `fields`: `{"Status": "Todo", "Priority": "High"}`

   b. **Field Creation with New Fields**: Call `update_project` with draft issue including new custom fields:
      - `project`: "https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/146"
      - `content_type`: "draft_issue"
      - `draft_title`: "Smoke Test Draft Issue with Custom Fields - Run ${{ github.run_id }}"
      - `fields`: `{"Status": "Todo", "Priority": "High", "Team": "Engineering", "Sprint": "Q1-2026"}`

   c. **Field Update**: Call `update_project` again with the same draft issue to update fields:
      - `project`: "https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/146"
      - `content_type`: "draft_issue"
      - `draft_title`: "Smoke Test Draft Issue - Run ${{ github.run_id }}"
      - `fields`: `{"Status": "In Progress", "Priority": "Medium"}`
   
   d. **Project Status Update**: Call `create_project_status_update` with:
      - `project`: "https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/146"
      - `body`: "Smoke test project status - Run ${{ github.run_id }}"
      - `status`: "ON_TRACK"
   
   f. **Verification**: For each operation:
      - Verify the safe-output message is properly formatted in the output file
      - Confirm the project URL is explicitly included in each message
      - Check that all field names and values are correctly structured
      - Validate content_type is correctly set for each operation type

## Output

1. **Create an issue** with a summary of the project smoke test run:
   - Title: "Smoke Test: Project Operations - ${{ github.run_id }}"
   - Body should include:
     - Test results (✅ or ❌ for each test)
     - Overall status: PASS or FAIL
     - Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
     - Timestamp

2. Add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the current pull request with:
   - Test results (✅ or ❌ for each test)
   - Overall status: PASS or FAIL

If all tests pass:
- Use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label `smoke-project` to the pull request
- Use the `remove_labels` safe-output tool to remove the label `smoke-project` from the pull request
