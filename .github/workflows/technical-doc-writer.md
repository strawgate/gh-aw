## Your Task

This workflow is triggered manually via workflow_dispatch with a documentation topic.

**Topic to review:** "${{ github.event.inputs.topic }}"

The documentation has been built successfully in the `docs/dist` folder. You can review both the source files in `docs/` and the built output in `docs/dist`.

### Available Commands

Use these commands from the repository root:

```bash
# Rebuild the documentation after making changes
make build-docs

# Start development server for live preview
make dev-docs

# Preview built documentation
make preview-docs

# Clean documentation artifacts
make clean-docs
```

### Documentation Review Process

When reviewing documentation for the specified topic in the **docs/** folder:

1. **Analyze the topic** provided in the workflow input: "${{ github.event.inputs.topic }}"

2. **Review relevant documentation files** in the docs/ folder related to the topic

3. **Make improvements** to the documentation as needed:
   - Fix clarity and conciseness issues
   - Improve tone and voice consistency with GitHub Docs
   - Enhance code block formatting and examples
   - Improve structure and organization
   - Add missing prerequisites or setup steps
   - Fix inappropriate use of GitHub alerts
   - Improve link quality and accessibility

4. **Rebuild and verify** after making changes:
   ```bash
   make build-docs
   ```
   - Fix any build errors that occur
   - Verify all links validate correctly
   - Ensure proper rendering in `docs/dist`

5. **Only after successful build**, create a pull request with improvements:
   - Use the safe-outputs create-pull-request functionality
   - Include a clear description of the improvements made
   - Document any build issues that were fixed
   - Only create a pull request if you have made actual changes

### Build Verification Requirements

**Before returning to the user or creating a pull request:**

- ✅ Run `make build-docs` to verify documentation builds successfully
- ✅ Fix any build errors, warnings, or link validation issues
- ✅ Verify the built output in `docs/dist` is properly generated
- ✅ Confirm all changes render correctly

**If build errors occur:**
- Read error messages carefully to understand the issue
- Fix broken links, invalid frontmatter, or markdown syntax errors
- Rebuild with `make build-docs` to verify fixes
- Do not proceed until the build succeeds without errors

Keep your feedback specific, actionable, and empathetic. Focus on the most impactful improvements for the topic: "${{ github.event.inputs.topic }}"

You have access to cache-memory for persistent storage across runs, which you can use to track documentation patterns and improvement suggestions.

**Important**: If no action is needed after completing your analysis, you **MUST** call the `noop` safe-output tool with a brief explanation. Failing to call any safe-output tool is the most common cause of safe-output workflow failures.

```json
{"noop": {"message": "No action needed: [brief explanation of what was analyzed and why]"}}
```
