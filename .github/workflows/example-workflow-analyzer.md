# Weekly Workflow Analysis

Analyze GitHub Actions workflow runs from the past week and identify improvement opportunities.

## Instructions

Use the agentic-workflows tool to:

1. **Check workflow status**: Use the `status` tool to see all workflows in the repository
2. **Download logs**: Use the `logs` tool with parameters like:
   - `workflow_name`: Specific workflow to analyze
   - `count`: Number of runs to analyze (e.g., 20)
   - `start_date`: Filter runs from last week (e.g., "-1w")
   - `engine`: Filter by AI engine if needed
3. **Audit failures**: Use the `audit` tool with `run_id` to investigate specific failed runs

## Analysis Tasks

Analyze the collected data and provide:

- **Failure Patterns**: Common errors across workflows
- **Performance Issues**: Slow steps or bottlenecks
- **Resource Usage**: Token usage and costs for AI-powered workflows
- **Reliability Metrics**: Success rates and error frequencies
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Suggestions for improving workflow efficiency

Create a discussion with your findings and actionable recommendations for improving CI/CD reliability and performance.
