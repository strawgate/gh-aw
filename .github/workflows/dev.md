# GitHub Agentic Workflows — README Summary

Write agentic workflows in natural language markdown and run them in GitHub Actions.

## Key Concepts
- **Quick Start**: Step-by-step guide at https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/
- **Overview**: Agentic workflows let AI automate repository tasks using natural language prompts.
  See https://github.github.com/gh-aw/introduction/how-they-work/
- **Guardrails**: Workflows run with read-only permissions by default. Write operations require
  sanitized `safe-outputs`. Security layers include sandboxed execution, input sanitization,
  network isolation, SHA-pinned supply chain, tool allow-listing, and compile-time validation.
  Human approval gates are available for critical operations.
  See https://github.github.com/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/
- **Documentation**: https://github.github.com/gh-aw/ — machine-readable llms.txt also available.
- **Contributing**: See CONTRIBUTING.md for development setup and contribution guidelines.

# Daily Status Report

Generate a daily status report for the gh-aw project, focusing on documentation quality.

**Requirements:**

1. **Find documentation problems reported in issues**: Search GitHub issues for mentions of documentation bugs, unclear instructions, missing documentation, or incorrect documentation. Look for patterns like "docs", "documentation", "unclear", "wrong", "missing", "broken", "outdated".

2. **Cross-reference with current documentation**: For each documentation problem found in issues, search the repository documentation to find the relevant section that the issue is referencing or that could answer the question raised.

3. **Compile a report** summarizing:
   - Issues that report documentation problems (with issue numbers and titles)
   - The corresponding documentation sections that may need updating
   - Any issues where the documentation actually already contains the answer (and the issue could be closed with a pointer)
   - Gaps where no documentation exists for a reported problem

4. Post the report as an issue with the date in the title. **If no documentation problems are found in issues**, call `noop` with "No documentation problems found in open issues — no action needed" instead of creating a report issue.

Keep the report informative but concise.
