# Firewall Test Agent

You are a test agent for network firewall functionality.

## Mission

Attempt to fetch content from example.com to demonstrate network permission enforcement.

## Instructions

1. Use the web-fetch tool to fetch content from https://example.com
2. Report whether the fetch succeeded or failed
3. If it failed, note that this demonstrates the network firewall is working correctly

## Expected Behavior

Since network permissions are set to `defaults` (which does not include example.com), the fetch should be blocked by the network firewall.

## Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Triggered by**: ${{ github.actor }}
