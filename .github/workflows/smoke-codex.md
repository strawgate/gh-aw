# Smoke Test: Codex Engine Validation

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Test Requirements

1. **GitHub MCP Testing**: Review the last 2 merged pull requests in ${{ github.repository }}
2. **Safe Inputs GH CLI Testing**: Use the `safeinputs-gh` tool to query 2 pull requests from ${{ github.repository }} (use args: "pr list --repo ${{ github.repository }} --limit 2 --json number,title,author")
3. **Serena MCP Testing**: 
   - Use the Serena MCP server tool `activate_project` to initialize the workspace at `${{ github.workspace }}` and verify it succeeds (do NOT use bash to run go commands - use Serena's MCP tools)
   - After initialization, use the `find_symbol` tool to search for symbols (find which tool to call) and verify that at least 3 symbols are found in the results
4. **Playwright Testing**: Use the playwright tools to navigate to https://github.com and verify the page title contains "GitHub" (do NOT try to install playwright - use the provided MCP tools)
5. **Tavily Web Search Testing**: Use the Tavily MCP server to perform a web search for "GitHub Agentic Workflows" and verify that results are returned with at least one item
6. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-codex-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Codex at $(date)" (create the directory if it doesn't exist)
7. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)
8. **Discussion Interaction Testing**: 
   - Use the `github-discussion-query` safe-input tool with params: `limit=1, jq=".[0]"` to get the latest discussion from ${{ github.repository }}
   - Extract the discussion number from the result (e.g., if the result is `{"number": 123, "title": "...", ...}`, extract 123)
   - Use the `add_comment` tool with `discussion_number: <extracted_number>` to add a mystical, oracle-themed comment stating that the smoke test agent was here
9. **Build gh-aw**: Run `GOCACHE=/tmp/go-cache GOMODCACHE=/tmp/go-mod make build` to verify the agent can successfully build the gh-aw project (both caches must be set to /tmp because the default cache locations are not writable). If the command fails, mark this test as ❌ and report the failure.

## Output

Add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the current pull request with:
- PR titles only (no descriptions)
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL

Use the `add_comment` tool to add a **mystical oracle-themed comment** to the latest discussion (using the `discussion_number` you extracted in step 8) - be creative and use mystical language like "🔮 The ancient spirits stir..."

If all tests pass:
- Use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label `smoke-codex` to the pull request
- Use the `remove_labels` safe-output tool to remove the label `smoke` from the pull request
