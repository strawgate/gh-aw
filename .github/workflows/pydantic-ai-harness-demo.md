# Pydantic AI Harness — Drop-in Engine Demo

This workflow does not use the Claude Code CLI. gh-aw's `engine.command`
override points the agent invocation at a Pydantic AI based harness
(`.github/scripts/pydantic-ai-runner`) that accepts the Claude Code CLI
argument surface, reads the gh-aw prompt, bridges gh-aw's MCP gateway, runs a
model through gh-aw's AWF firewall + credential-injecting proxy, and emits
Claude-compatible stream-json.

A focused end-to-end self-test with assertions lives in
`pydantic-ai-pr-selftest.md`; this workflow is the minimal manual reference
for wiring the harness as an engine.

## Task

Keep it short:

1. Print the banner line: `PYDANTIC_AI_HARNESS_DEMO_OK`.
2. State the repository (`${{ github.repository }}`).
3. Use the `bash` tool to run `uname -sm` and report the output, demonstrating
   that the harness drives a real multi-step tool loop.

Do not modify any files. Keep the final message under ~120 words.
