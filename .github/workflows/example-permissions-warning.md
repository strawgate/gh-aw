# Example: Properly Provisioned Permissions

This workflow demonstrates properly configured permissions for GitHub toolsets.

The workflow uses three GitHub toolsets with appropriate write permissions:
- The `repos` toolset requires `contents: write` for repository operations
- The `issues` toolset requires `issues: write` for issue management
- The `pull_requests` toolset requires `pull-requests: write` for PR operations

All required permissions are properly declared in the frontmatter, so this workflow
compiles without warnings and can execute successfully when dispatched.
