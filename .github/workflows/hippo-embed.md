# Hippo Memory — Audit and Embed

You are an AI agent running a maintenance pass to restore semantic recall quality in
the Hippo memory store. The store has grown to ~490 memories but fewer than 1% have
been embedded, severely degrading semantic search. Complete the steps below in order.

## Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Memory store**: `.hippo/` (persisted in cache-memory across runs)

## Step 1 — Audit and interactively prune low-quality entries

Run the audit command and review each flagged low-quality memory in the guided
interface. Approve pruning for stale or low-signal entries (too-short fragments,
commit noise, vague notes) before embedding so they do not pollute the vector index:

```
mcpscripts-hippo args: "audit"
```

This maintenance pass is expected to include 7 low-quality memories flagged for
review. Note how many entries are pruned for your summary.

## Step 2 — Embed all memories

Generate vector embeddings for every memory in the store. This enables hybrid
BM25 + cosine similarity search and significantly improves semantic recall quality:

```
mcpscripts-hippo args: "embed"
```

This may take several minutes for a store of ~490 memories. Wait for completion.

## Step 3 — Verify and report

Check the store status to confirm embeddings were generated:

```
mcpscripts-hippo args: "status"
```

Then print a short summary to stdout (using the bash echo tool) covering:
- Memories pruned by audit
- Memories embedded (before vs. after)
- Whether semantic recall is now operational
