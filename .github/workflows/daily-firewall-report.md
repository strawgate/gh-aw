# Daily Firewall Logs Collector and Reporter

Collect and analyze firewall logs from all agentic workflows that use the firewall feature.

## 📊 Trend Charts Requirement

**IMPORTANT**: Generate exactly 2 trend charts that showcase firewall activity patterns over time.

### Chart Generation Process

**Phase 1: Data Collection**

Collect data for the past 30 days (or available data) from firewall audit logs:

1. **Firewall Request Data**:
   - Count of allowed requests per day
   - Count of blocked requests per day
   - Total requests per day

2. **Top Blocked Domains Data**:
   - Frequency of top 10 blocked domains over the period
   - Trends in blocking patterns by domain category

**Phase 2: Data Preparation**

1. Create CSV files in `/tmp/gh-aw/python/data/` with the collected data:
   - `firewall_requests.csv` - Daily allowed/blocked request counts
   - `blocked_domains.csv` - Top blocked domains with frequencies

2. Each CSV should have a date column and metric columns with appropriate headers

**Phase 3: Chart Generation**

Generate exactly **2 high-quality trend charts**:

**Chart 1: Firewall Request Trends**
- Stacked area chart or multi-line chart showing:
  - Allowed requests (area/line, green)
  - Blocked requests (area/line, red)
  - Total requests trend line
- X-axis: Date (last 30 days)
- Y-axis: Request count
- Save as: `/tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/firewall_requests_trends.png`

**Chart 2: Top Blocked Domains Frequency**
- Horizontal bar chart showing:
  - Top 10-15 most frequently blocked domains
  - Total block count for each domain
  - Color-coded by domain category if applicable
- X-axis: Block count
- Y-axis: Domain names
- Save as: `/tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/blocked_domains_frequency.png`

**Chart Quality Requirements**:
- DPI: 300 minimum
- Figure size: 12x7 inches for better readability
- Use seaborn styling with a professional color palette
- Include grid lines for easier reading
- Clear, large labels and legend
- Title with context (e.g., "Firewall Activity - Last 30 Days")
- Annotations for significant spikes or patterns

**Phase 4: Upload Charts**

1. Upload both charts using the `upload asset` tool
2. Collect the returned URLs for embedding in the discussion

**Phase 5: Embed Charts in Discussion**

Include the charts in your firewall report with this structure:

```markdown
## 📈 Firewall Activity Trends

### Request Patterns
![Firewall Request Trends](URL_FROM_UPLOAD_ASSET_CHART_1)

[Brief 2-3 sentence analysis of firewall activity trends, noting increases in blocked traffic or changes in patterns]

### Top Blocked Domains
![Blocked Domains Frequency](URL_FROM_UPLOAD_ASSET_CHART_2)

[Brief 2-3 sentence analysis of frequently blocked domains, identifying potential security concerns or overly restrictive rules]
```

### Python Implementation Notes

- Use pandas for data manipulation and date handling
- Use matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for visualization
- Set appropriate date formatters for x-axis labels
- Use `plt.xticks(rotation=45)` for readable date labels
- Apply `plt.tight_layout()` before saving
- Handle cases where data might be sparse or missing

### Error Handling

If insufficient data is available (less than 7 days):
- Generate the charts with available data
- Add a note in the analysis mentioning the limited data range
- Consider using a bar chart instead of line chart for very sparse data

## 📝 Report Formatting Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Follow these formatting guidelines to create well-structured, readable reports:

### 1. Header Levels
**Use h3 (###) or lower for all headers in your report to maintain proper document hierarchy.**

The discussion title serves as h1, so all content headers should start at h3:
- Use `###` for main sections (e.g., "### Executive Summary", "### Top Blocked Domains")
- Use `####` for subsections (e.g., "#### Blocked Domains by Workflow")
- Never use `##` (h2) or `#` (h1) in the report body

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
**Wrap detailed request logs and domain lists in `<details><summary><b>Section Name</b></summary>` tags to improve readability and reduce scrolling.**

Use collapsible sections for:
- Detailed request patterns and logs
- Per-workflow domain breakdowns (Section 3 below)
- Complete blocked domains list (Section 4 below)
- Verbose firewall data and statistics

Example:
```markdown
<details>
<summary><b>Full Request Log Details</b></summary>

[Long detailed content here...]

</details>
```

### 3. Report Structure Pattern

Your report should follow this structure for optimal readability:

1. **Brief Summary** (always visible): 1-2 paragraph overview of firewall activity
2. **Key Metrics** (always visible): Total requests, blocks, trends, block rate
3. **Top Blocked Domains** (always visible): Top 20 most frequently blocked domains in a table
4. **Detailed Request Patterns** (in `<details>` tags): Per-workflow breakdowns with domain tables
5. **Complete Blocked Domains List** (in `<details>` tags): Alphabetically sorted full list
6. **Security Recommendations** (always visible): Actionable insights and suggestions

### Design Principles

Create reports that:
- **Build trust through clarity**: Most important info (metrics, top domains, recommendations) immediately visible
- **Exceed expectations**: Add helpful context, trends, and security insights
- **Create delight**: Use progressive disclosure to reduce overwhelm for detailed data
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow the same patterns as other reporting workflows

---

## Objective

Generate a comprehensive daily report of all rejected domains across all agentic workflows that use the firewall feature. This helps identify:
- Which domains are being blocked
- Patterns in blocked traffic
- Potential issues with network permissions
- Security insights from blocked requests

## Instructions

### MCP Servers are Pre-loaded

**IMPORTANT**: The MCP servers configured in this workflow (including `gh-aw` with tools like `logs` and `audit`) are automatically loaded and available at agent startup. You do NOT need to:
- Use the inspector tool to discover MCP servers
- Run any external tools to check available MCP servers
- Verify or list MCP servers before using them

Simply call the MCP tools directly as described in the steps below. If you want to know what tools are available, you can list them using your built-in tool listing capability.

### Step 0: Fresh Analysis - No Caching

**ALWAYS PERFORM FRESH ANALYSIS**: This report must always use fresh data from the audit tool. 

**DO NOT**:
- Skip analysis based on cached results
- Reuse aggregated statistics from previous runs
- Check for or use any cached run IDs, counts, or domain lists

**ALWAYS**:
- Collect all workflow runs fresh using the `logs` tool
- Fetch complete firewall data from the `audit` tool for each run
- Compute all statistics fresh (blocked counts, allowed counts, domain lists)

This ensures accurate, up-to-date reporting for every run of this workflow.

### Step 1: Collect Recent Firewall-Enabled Workflow Runs

Use the `logs` tool from the agentic-workflows MCP server to efficiently collect workflow runs that have firewall enabled (see `workflow_runs_analyzed` in scratchpad/metrics-glossary.md - Scope: Last 7 days):

**Using the logs tool:**
Call the `logs` tool with the following parameters:
- `firewall`: true (boolean - to filter only runs with firewall enabled)
- `start_date`: "-7d" (to get runs from the past 7 days)
- `count`: 100 (to get up to 100 matching runs)

The tool will:
1. Filter runs based on the `steps.firewall` field in `aw_info.json` (e.g., "squid" when enabled)
2. Return only runs where firewall was enabled
3. Limit to runs from the past 7 days
4. Return up to 100 matching runs

**Tool call example:**
```json
{
  "firewall": true,
  "start_date": "-7d",
  "count": 100
}
```

### Step 1.5: Early Exit if No Data

**IMPORTANT**: If Step 1 returns zero workflow runs (no firewall-enabled workflows ran in the past 7 days):

1. **Do NOT create a discussion or report**
2. **Exit early** with a brief log message: "No firewall-enabled workflow runs found in the past 7 days. Exiting without creating a report."
3. **Stop processing** - do not proceed to Step 2 or any subsequent steps

This prevents creating empty or meaningless reports when there's no data to analyze.

### Step 2: Analyze Firewall Logs from Collected Runs

For each run collected in Step 1:
1. Use the `audit` tool from the agentic-workflows MCP server to get detailed firewall information
2. Store the run ID, workflow name, and timestamp for tracking

**Using the audit tool:**
Call the `audit` tool with the run_id parameter for each run from Step 1.

**Tool call example:**
```json
{
  "run_id": 12345678
}
```

The audit tool returns structured firewall analysis data including:
- Total requests, allowed requests, blocked requests
- Lists of allowed and blocked domains
- Request statistics per domain

**Example of extracting firewall data from audit result:**
```javascript
// From the audit tool result, access:
result.firewall_analysis.blocked_domains  // Array of blocked domain names
result.firewall_analysis.allowed_domains  // Array of allowed domain names
result.firewall_analysis.total_requests   // Total number of network requests
result.firewall_analysis.blocked_requests  // Number of blocked requests
```

**Important:** Do NOT manually download and parse firewall log files. Always use the `audit` tool which provides structured firewall analysis data.

### Step 3: Parse and Analyze Firewall Logs

Use the JSON output from the `audit` tool to extract firewall information. The `firewall_analysis` field in the audit JSON contains:
- `total_requests` - Total number of network requests
- `allowed_requests` - Count of allowed requests
- `blocked_requests` - Count of blocked requests
- `allowed_domains` - Array of unique allowed domains
- `blocked_domains` - Array of unique blocked domains
- `requests_by_domain` - Object mapping domains to request statistics (allowed/blocked counts)

**Example jq filter for aggregating blocked domains:**
```bash
# Get only blocked domains across multiple runs
gh aw audit <run-id> --json | jq -r '.firewall_analysis.blocked_domains[]? // empty'

# Get blocked domain statistics with counts
gh aw audit <run-id> --json | jq -r '
  .firewall_analysis.requests_by_domain // {} | 
  to_entries[] | 
  select(.value.blocked > 0) | 
  "\(.key): \(.value.blocked) blocked, \(.value.allowed) allowed"
'
```

For each workflow run with firewall data (see standardized metric names in scratchpad/metrics-glossary.md):
1. Extract the firewall analysis from the audit JSON output
2. Track the following metrics per workflow:
   - Total requests (`firewall_requests_total`)
   - Allowed requests count (`firewall_requests_allowed`)
   - Blocked requests count (`firewall_requests_blocked`)
   - List of unique blocked domains (`firewall_domains_blocked`)
   - Domain-level statistics (from `requests_by_domain`)

### Step 4: Aggregate Results

Combine data from all workflows (using standardized metric names):
1. Create a master list of all blocked domains across all workflows
2. Track how many times each domain was blocked
3. Track which workflows blocked which domains
4. Calculate overall statistics:
   - Total workflows analyzed (`workflow_runs_analyzed` - Scope: Last 7 days)
   - Total runs analyzed
   - Total blocked domains (`firewall_domains_blocked`) - unique count
   - Total blocked requests (`firewall_requests_blocked`)

### Step 5: Generate Report

Create a comprehensive markdown report following the formatting guidelines above. Structure your report as follows:

#### Section 1: Executive Summary (Always Visible)
A brief 1-2 paragraph overview including:
- Date of report (today's date)
- Total workflows analyzed (`workflow_runs_analyzed`)
- Total runs analyzed
- Overall firewall activity snapshot (key highlights, trends, concerns)

#### Section 2: Key Metrics (Always Visible)
Present the core statistics:
- Total network requests monitored (`firewall_requests_total`)
  - ✅ **Allowed** (`firewall_requests_allowed`): Count of successful requests
  - 🚫 **Blocked** (`firewall_requests_blocked`): Count of blocked requests
- **Block rate**: Percentage of blocked requests (blocked / total * 100)
- Total unique blocked domains (`firewall_domains_blocked`)

> **Terminology Note**: 
> - **Allowed requests** = Requests that successfully reached their destination
> - **Blocked requests** = Requests that were prevented by the firewall
> - A 0% block rate with listed blocked domains indicates domains that would 
>   be blocked if accessed, but weren't actually accessed during this period

#### Section 3: Top Blocked Domains (Always Visible)
A table showing the most frequently blocked domains:
- Domain name
- Number of times blocked
- Workflows that blocked it
- Domain category (Development Services, Social Media, Analytics/Tracking, CDN, Other)

Sort by frequency (most blocked first), show top 20.

#### Section 4: Detailed Request Patterns (In `<details>` Tags)
**IMPORTANT**: Wrap this entire section in a collapsible `<details>` block:

```markdown
<details>
<summary><b>View Detailed Request Patterns by Workflow</b></summary>

For each workflow that had blocked domains, provide a detailed breakdown:

#### Workflow: [workflow-name] (X runs analyzed)

| Domain | Blocked Count | Allowed Count | Block Rate | Category |
|--------|---------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| example.com | 15 | 5 | 75% | Social Media |
| api.example.org | 10 | 0 | 100% | Development |

- Total blocked requests: [count]
- Total unique blocked domains: [count]
- Most frequently blocked domain: [domain]

[Repeat for all workflows with blocked domains]

</details>
```

#### Section 5: Complete Blocked Domains List (In `<details>` Tags)
**IMPORTANT**: Wrap this entire section in a collapsible `<details>` block:

```markdown
<details>
<summary><b>View Complete Blocked Domains List</b></summary>

An alphabetically sorted list of all unique blocked domains:

| Domain | Total Blocks | First Seen | Workflows |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| [domain] | [count] | [date] | [workflow-list] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

</details>
```

#### Section 6: Security Recommendations (Always Visible)
Based on the analysis, provide actionable insights:
- Domains that appear to be legitimate services that should be allowlisted
- Potential security concerns (e.g., suspicious domains)
- Suggestions for network permission improvements
- Workflows that might need their network permissions updated

### Step 6: Create Discussion

Create a new GitHub discussion with:
- **Title**: "Daily Firewall Report - [Today's Date]"
- **Category**: audits
- **Body**: The complete markdown report following the formatting guidelines and structure defined in Step 5

Ensure the discussion body:
- Uses h3 (###) for main section headers
- Uses h4 (####) for subsection headers
- Wraps detailed data (per-workflow breakdowns, complete domain list) in `<details>` tags
- Keeps critical information visible (summary, key metrics, top domains, recommendations)

## Notes

- **Early exit**: If no firewall-enabled workflow runs are found in the past 7 days, exit early without creating a report (see Step 1.5)
- Include timestamps and run URLs for traceability
- Use tables and formatting for better readability
- Add emojis to make the report more engaging (🔥 for firewall, 🚫 for blocked, ✅ for allowed)

## Expected Output

A GitHub discussion in the "audits" category containing a comprehensive daily firewall analysis report.
