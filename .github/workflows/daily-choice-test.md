# Daily Choice Type Test

This workflow tests the choice type functionality in safe-output jobs with Claude.

## Task

Use the `test_environment` tool to configure a test deployment. Choose:
1. An environment: staging or production
2. A test type: smoke, integration, or e2e

Make your selection based on the day of the week:
- Monday/Wednesday/Friday: Use "staging" environment with "smoke" tests
- Tuesday/Thursday: Use "production" environment with "integration" tests

Provide a brief explanation of why you chose this configuration.
