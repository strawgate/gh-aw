# Weekly Issue Summary

## 📊 Trend Charts Requirement

**IMPORTANT**: Generate exactly 2 trend charts that showcase issue activity patterns over time.

### Chart Generation Process

**Phase 1: Data Collection**

Collect data for the past 30 days (or available data) using GitHub API:

1. **Issue Activity Data**:
   - Count of issues opened per day
   - Count of issues closed per day
   - Running count of open issues

2. **Issue Resolution Data**:
   - Average time to close issues (in days)
   - Distribution of issue lifespans
   - Issues by label category over time

**Phase 2: Data Preparation**

1. Create CSV files in `/tmp/gh-aw/python/data/` with the collected data:
   - `issue_activity.csv` - Daily opened/closed counts and open count
   - `issue_resolution.csv` - Resolution time statistics

2. Each CSV should have a date column and metric columns with appropriate headers

**Phase 3: Chart Generation**

Generate exactly **2 high-quality trend charts**:

**Chart 1: Issue Activity Trends**
- Multi-line chart showing:
  - Issues opened per week (line or bar)
  - Issues closed per week (line or bar)
  - Net change (opened - closed) per week
  - Running total of open issues (line)
- X-axis: Week (last 12 weeks or 30 days)
- Y-axis: Count
- Save as: `/tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/issue_activity_trends.png`

**Chart 2: Issue Resolution Time Trends**
- Line chart with statistics showing:
  - Average time to close (in days, 7-day moving average)
  - Median time to close
  - Shaded area showing resolution time variance
- X-axis: Date (last 30 days)
- Y-axis: Days to resolution
- Save as: `/tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/issue_resolution_trends.png`

**Chart Quality Requirements**:
- DPI: 300 minimum
- Figure size: 12x7 inches for better readability
- Use seaborn styling with a professional color palette
- Include grid lines for easier reading
- Clear, large labels and legend
- Title with context (e.g., "Issue Activity - Last 12 Weeks")
- Annotations for notable patterns or changes

**Phase 4: Upload Charts**

1. Upload both charts using the `upload asset` tool
2. Collect the returned URLs for embedding in the discussion

**Phase 5: Embed Charts in Discussion**

**Formatting Guidelines**: Use h3 (###) for main sections and h4 (####) for subsections in your weekly summary to maintain proper document hierarchy. The discussion title serves as h1.

Include the charts in your weekly summary with this structure:

```markdown
### 📈 Issue Activity Trends

#### Weekly Activity Patterns
![Issue Activity Trends](URL_FROM_UPLOAD_ASSET_CHART_1)

[Brief 2-3 sentence analysis of issue activity trends, highlighting increases/decreases in activity or backlog growth]

#### Resolution Time Analysis
![Issue Resolution Trends](URL_FROM_UPLOAD_ASSET_CHART_2)

[Brief 2-3 sentence analysis of how quickly issues are being resolved, noting improvements or slowdowns]
```

### Python Implementation Notes

- Use pandas for data manipulation and date handling
- Use matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for visualization
- Set appropriate date formatters for x-axis labels
- Use `plt.xticks(rotation=45)` for readable date labels
- Apply `plt.tight_layout()` before saving
- Handle cases where data might be sparse or missing

### Error Handling

If insufficient data is available (less than 7 days):
- Generate the charts with available data
- Add a note in the analysis mentioning the limited data range
- Consider using a bar chart instead of line chart for very sparse data

## 📝 Report Formatting Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Follow these formatting guidelines to create well-structured, readable reports:

### 1. Header Levels
**Use h3 (###) or lower for all headers in your report to maintain proper document hierarchy.**

The discussion title serves as h1, so all content headers should start at h3:
- Use `###` for main sections (e.g., "### Weekly Overview", "### Key Trends")
- Use `####` for subsections (e.g., "#### Issue Breakdown by Label")
- Never use `##` (h2) or `#` (h1) in the report body

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
**Wrap long sections in `<details><summary><b>Section Name</b></summary>` tags to improve readability and reduce scrolling.**

Use collapsible sections for:
- Full issue lists with titles and descriptions
- Detailed breakdowns by label or type
- Historical comparisons or verbose data

Example:
```markdown
<details>
<summary><b>Full Issue List</b></summary>

[Long list of issues...]

</details>
```

### 3. Report Structure Pattern

Your report should follow this structure for optimal readability:

1. **Weekly Overview** (always visible): 1-2 paragraph summary of the week's issue activity, highlighting key trends
2. **Key Trends** (always visible): Notable patterns like increased activity, common issue types, or emerging topics
3. **Summary Statistics** (always visible): Total counts, comparisons to previous week, breakdown by state/label
4. **Detailed Issue Breakdown** (in `<details>` tags): Complete list of issues with titles, numbers, authors, and labels
5. **Recommendations for Upcoming Week** (always visible): Actionable suggestions based on the analysis

### Design Principles

Create reports that:
- **Build trust through clarity**: Most important info (overview, trends, key stats) immediately visible
- **Exceed expectations**: Add helpful context, week-over-week comparisons, trend analysis
- **Create delight**: Use progressive disclosure to reduce overwhelm for detailed data
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow the same patterns as other reporting workflows

## Weekly Analysis

Analyze all issues opened in the repository ${{ github.repository }} over the last 7 days.

Create a comprehensive summary that includes:
- Total number of issues opened
- List of issue titles with their numbers and authors
- Any notable patterns or trends (common labels, types of issues, etc.)

Follow the **Report Formatting Guidelines** above to structure your report with:
- h3 (###) for main section headers
- Detailed issue lists wrapped in `<details>` tags
- Critical information (overview, trends, statistics, recommendations) always visible
