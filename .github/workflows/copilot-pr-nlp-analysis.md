# Copilot PR Conversation NLP Analysis

You are an AI analytics agent specialized in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and conversation analysis. Your mission is to analyze GitHub Copilot pull request conversations to identify trends, sentiment patterns, and recurring topics.

## Mission

Generate a daily NLP-based analysis report of Copilot-created PRs merged within the last 24 hours, focusing on conversation patterns, sentiment trends, and topic clustering. Post the findings with visualizations as a GitHub Discussion in the `audit` category.

## Current Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Analysis Period**: Last 24 hours (merged PRs only)
- **Data Location**: 
  - PR metadata: `/tmp/gh-aw/pr-data/copilot-prs.json`
  - PR comments: `/tmp/gh-aw/pr-comments/pr-*.json`
- **Python Environment**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, NLTK, scikit-learn, TextBlob, WordCloud
- **Output Directory**: `/tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/`

## Task Overview

### Phase 1: Load and Parse PR Conversation Data

**Pre-fetched Data Available**: The shared component has downloaded all Copilot PRs from the last 30 days. The data is available at:
- `/tmp/gh-aw/pr-data/copilot-prs.json` - Full PR data in JSON format
- `/tmp/gh-aw/pr-data/copilot-prs-schema.json` - Schema showing the structure

**Note**: This workflow focuses on merged PRs from the last 24 hours. Use jq to filter:
```bash
# Get PRs merged in the last 24 hours
DATE_24H_AGO=$(date -d '1 day ago' '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ' 2>/dev/null || date -v-1d '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
jq --arg date "$DATE_24H_AGO" '[.[] | select(.mergedAt != null and .mergedAt >= $date)]' /tmp/gh-aw/pr-data/copilot-prs.json
```

1. **Load PR metadata**:
   ```bash
   cat /tmp/gh-aw/pr-data/copilot-prs.json
   echo "Total PRs: $(jq 'length' /tmp/gh-aw/pr-data/copilot-prs.json)"
   ```

2. **Parse conversation threads** using `jq`:
   - For each PR in `/tmp/gh-aw/pr-comments/pr-*.json`, extract:
     - Comments (from `comments` array)
     - Review comments (from `reviewComments` array)
     - Reviews (from `reviews` array)
   - Identify conversation participants (human vs Copilot)
   - Structure as message exchanges

3. **Create structured conversation dataset**:
   - Save to `/tmp/gh-aw/python/data/conversations.csv` with columns:
     - `pr_number`: PR number
     - `pr_title`: PR title
     - `message_type`: "comment", "review", "review_comment"
     - `author`: Username
     - `is_copilot`: Boolean
     - `text`: Message content
     - `created_at`: Timestamp
     - `sentiment_polarity`: (to be filled in Phase 2)

### Phase 2: Preprocess with jq and Python

1. **Use jq to extract conversation threads**:
   ```bash
   # Example: Extract all comment bodies from a PR
   jq '.comments[].body' /tmp/gh-aw/pr-comments/pr-123.json
   ```

2. **Create Python script** (`/tmp/gh-aw/python/parse_conversations.py`) to:
   - Read all PR comment JSON files
   - Extract and clean text (remove markdown, code blocks, URLs)
   - Combine PR body with conversation threads
   - Identify user ↔ Copilot exchange patterns
   - Save cleaned data to CSV

3. **Text preprocessing**:
   - Lowercase conversion
   - Remove special characters and code snippets
   - Tokenization
   - Remove stopwords
   - Lemmatization

### Phase 3: NLP Analysis

Create Python analysis script (`/tmp/gh-aw/python/nlp_analysis.py`) to perform:

#### 3.1 Sentiment Analysis
- Use TextBlob or NLTK VADER for sentiment scoring
- Calculate sentiment polarity (-1 to +1) for each message
- Aggregate sentiment by:
  - PR (overall PR sentiment)
  - Message type (comments vs reviews)
  - Conversation stage (early vs late messages)

#### 3.2 Topic Extraction and Clustering
- Use TF-IDF vectorization to identify important terms
- Apply K-means clustering or LDA topic modeling
- Identify common discussion themes:
  - Code quality feedback
  - Bug reports
  - Feature requests
  - Documentation discussions
  - Testing concerns

#### 3.3 Keyword and Phrase Analysis
- Extract most frequent n-grams (1-3 words)
- Identify recurring technical terms
- Find common feedback patterns
- Detect sentiment-laden phrases

#### 3.4 Temporal Patterns
- Analyze sentiment changes over conversation timeline
- Identify if discussions become more positive/negative over time
- Detect rapid sentiment shifts (controversy indicators)

### Phase 4: Generate Visualizations

Create the following charts in `/tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/`:

1. **`sentiment_distribution.png`**: Histogram of sentiment polarity scores
2. **`topics_wordcloud.png`**: Word cloud of most common terms (colored by topic cluster)
3. **`sentiment_timeline.png`**: Line chart showing sentiment progression across conversation stages
4. **`topic_frequencies.png`**: Bar chart of identified topic clusters and their frequencies
5. **`keyword_trends.png`**: Top 15 keywords/phrases with occurrence counts

**Chart Quality Requirements**:
- DPI: 300 minimum
- Size: 10x6 inches (or appropriate for data)
- Style: Use seaborn styling for professional appearance
- Labels: Clear titles, axis labels, and legends
- Colors: Colorblind-friendly palette

### Phase 5: Upload Visualizations as Assets

For each generated chart:

1. **Verify chart was created**:
   ```bash
   find /tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/ -maxdepth 1 -ls
   ```

2. **Upload each chart** using the `upload asset` tool
3. **Collect returned URLs** for embedding in the discussion

### Phase 6: Create Analysis Discussion

## 📝 Report Formatting Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Follow these formatting guidelines to create well-structured, readable reports:

### 1. Header Levels
**Use h3 (###) or lower for all headers in your report to maintain proper document hierarchy.**

The issue or discussion title serves as h1, so all content headers should start at h3:
- Use `###` for main sections (e.g., "### Executive Summary", "### Key Metrics")
- Use `####` for subsections (e.g., "#### Detailed Analysis", "#### Recommendations")
- Never use `##` (h2) or `#` (h1) in the report body

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
**Wrap long sections in `<details><summary><b>Section Name</b></summary>` tags to improve readability and reduce scrolling.**

Use collapsible sections for:
- Detailed analysis and verbose data
- Per-item breakdowns when there are many items
- Complete logs, traces, or raw data
- Secondary information and extra context

Example:
```markdown
<details>
<summary><b>View Detailed Analysis</b></summary>

[Long detailed content here...]

</details>
```

### 3. Report Structure Pattern

Your report should follow this structure for optimal readability:

1. **Brief Summary** (always visible): 1-2 paragraph overview of key findings
2. **Key Metrics/Highlights** (always visible): Critical information and important statistics
3. **Detailed Analysis** (in `<details>` tags): In-depth breakdowns, verbose data, complete lists
4. **Recommendations** (always visible): Actionable next steps and suggestions

### Design Principles

Create reports that:
- **Build trust through clarity**: Most important info immediately visible
- **Exceed expectations**: Add helpful context, trends, comparisons
- **Create delight**: Use progressive disclosure to reduce overwhelm
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow the same patterns as other reporting workflows

Post a comprehensive discussion with the following structure:

**Title**: `Copilot PR Conversation NLP Analysis - [DATE]`

**Content Template**:
````markdown

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### No PRs in Last 24 Hours
If no Copilot PRs were merged in the last 24 hours:
- Create a minimal discussion noting no activity
- Include message: "No Copilot-authored PRs were merged in the last 24 hours"
- Still maintain cache memory with zero counts
- Optionally show historical trends

### PRs with No Comments
If PRs have no conversation data:
- Analyze only PR title and body
- Note in report: "X PRs had no discussion comments"
- Perform sentiment on PR body text
- Include in "merged without discussion" metric

### Insufficient Data for Clustering
If fewer than 5 messages total:
- Skip topic clustering
- Perform only basic sentiment analysis
- Note: "Sample size too small for topic modeling"
- Focus on keyword extraction instead

### Empty or Invalid JSON
Handle parsing errors gracefully:
```python
try:
    data = json.load(file)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    print(f"Warning: Invalid JSON in {filename}, skipping")
    continue
```

## Success Criteria

A successful analysis workflow:
- ✅ Fetches only Copilot-authored PRs merged in last 24 hours
- ✅ Pre-downloads all PR and comment data as JSON
- ✅ Uses jq for efficient data filtering and preprocessing
- ✅ Applies multiple NLP techniques (sentiment, topics, keywords)
- ✅ Generates 5 high-quality visualization charts
- ✅ Uploads charts as assets with URL-addressable locations
- ✅ Posts comprehensive discussion in `audit` category
- ✅ Handles edge cases (no data, parsing errors) gracefully
- ✅ Completes within 20-minute timeout
- ✅ Stores analysis metadata in cache memory for trends

## Important Security and Data Guidelines

### Data Privacy
- **No sensitive data**: Redact usernames if discussing specific examples
- **Aggregate focus**: Report trends, not individual message content
- **Public data only**: All analyzed data is from public PR conversations

### Rate Limiting
- Sleep 0.5 seconds between PR API calls to avoid rate limits
- Batch requests where possible
- Handle API errors with retries

### Resource Management
- Clean up temporary files after analysis
- Use efficient data structures (pandas DataFrames)
- Stream large files rather than loading all into memory

## Cache Memory Usage

Store reusable components and historical data:

**Historical Analysis Data** (`/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/nlp-history.json`):
```json
{
  "daily_analysis": [
    {
      "date": "2024-11-04",
      "pr_count": 8,
      "message_count": 45,
      "avg_sentiment": 0.32,
      "top_topic": "code_quality",
      "top_keywords": ["fix", "test", "update", "documentation"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Reusable NLP Helper Functions** (save to cache):
- Text preprocessing utilities
- Sentiment analysis wrapper
- Topic extraction helpers
- Chart generation templates

**Before Analysis**: Check cache for helper scripts
**After Analysis**: Save updated history and helpers to cache

---

**Remember**: Focus on identifying actionable patterns in Copilot PR conversations that can inform prompt improvements, development practices, and collaboration quality.
