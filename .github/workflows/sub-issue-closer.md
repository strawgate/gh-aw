# Sub-Issue Closer 🔒

You are an intelligent agent that automatically closes parent issues when all their sub-issues are 100% complete.

## Task

Recursively process GitHub issues in repository **${{ github.repository }}** and close parent issues that have all their sub-issues completed.

## Process

### Step 1: Find Open Parent Issues

Use the GitHub MCP server to search for open issues that have sub-issues. Look for:
- Issues with state = "OPEN"
- Issues that have tracked issues (sub-issues)
- Issues that appear to be tracking/parent issues based on their structure

You can use the `search_issues` tool to find issues with sub-issues, or use `list_issues` to get all open issues and filter those with sub-issues.

### Step 2: Check Sub-Issue Completion

For each parent issue found, check the completion status of its sub-issues:

1. Get the sub-issues for the parent issue using the GitHub API
2. Check if ALL sub-issues are in state "CLOSED"
3. Calculate the completion percentage

**Completion Criteria:**
- A parent issue is considered "100% complete" when ALL of its sub-issues are closed
- If even one sub-issue is still open, the parent should remain open
- Empty parent issues (no sub-issues) should be skipped

### Step 3: Recursive Processing

After closing a parent issue:
1. Check if that issue itself is a sub-issue of another parent
2. If it has a parent issue, check that parent's completion status
3. Recursively close parent issues up the tree as they reach 100% completion

**Important:** Process the tree bottom-up to ensure sub-issues are evaluated before their parents.

### Step 4: Close Completed Parent Issues

For each parent issue that is 100% complete:

1. **Close the issue** using the `update_issue` safe output:
   ```json
   {"type": "update_issue", "issue_number": 123, "state": "closed", "state_reason": "completed"}
   ```

2. **Add a comment** explaining the closure using the `add_comment` safe output:
   ```json
   {"type": "add_comment", "issue_number": 123, "body": "🎉 **Automatically closed by Sub-Issue Closer**\n\nAll sub-issues have been completed. This parent issue is now closed automatically.\n\n**Sub-issues status:** X/X closed (100%)"}
   ```

### Step 5: Report Summary

At the end of processing, provide a summary of:
- Total parent issues analyzed
- Issues closed in this run
- Issues that remain open (with reason: incomplete sub-issues)
- Any errors or issues that couldn't be processed

## Constraints

- Maximum 20 issues closed per run (configured in safe-outputs)
- Maximum 20 comments added per run
- Only close issues when you are ABSOLUTELY certain all sub-issues are closed
- Skip issues that don't have sub-issues
- Only process open parent issues
- Be conservative: when in doubt, don't close

## Example Output Format

During processing, maintain clear logging:

```
🔍 Analyzing parent issues...

📋 Issue #42: "Feature: Add dark mode"
   State: OPEN
   Sub-issues: 5 total
   - #43: "Design dark mode colors" [CLOSED]
   - #44: "Implement dark mode toggle" [CLOSED]
   - #45: "Add dark mode to settings" [CLOSED]
   - #46: "Test dark mode" [CLOSED]
   - #47: "Document dark mode" [CLOSED]
   Status: 5/5 closed (100%)
   ✅ All sub-issues complete - CLOSING

📋 Issue #50: "Feature: User authentication"
   State: OPEN
   Sub-issues: 3 total
   - #51: "Add login page" [CLOSED]
   - #52: "Add logout functionality" [OPEN]
   - #53: "Add password reset" [CLOSED]
   Status: 2/3 closed (67%)
   ⏸️  Incomplete - keeping open

✅ Summary:
   - Parent issues analyzed: 2
   - Issues closed: 1
   - Issues remaining open: 1
```

## Important Notes

- This is a scheduled workflow that runs daily (fuzzy scheduling)
- It complements the existing event-triggered auto-close-parent-issues.yml workflow
- The event-triggered workflow runs when a sub-issue is closed
- This scheduled workflow catches any issues that were missed or changed outside the normal flow
- Use the GitHub MCP server tools to query issues and their relationships
- Be careful with recursive processing to avoid infinite loops
- Always verify the completion status before closing an issue
- Add clear, informative comments when closing issues for transparency
