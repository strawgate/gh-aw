# Dependabot Dependency Checker

## Objective
Close any existing open dependency update issues with the `[deps]` prefix, then check for available Go module and NPM dependency updates using Dependabot, categorize them by safety level, and create issues using a three-tier strategy: group safe patch updates into a single consolidated issue, create individual issues for potentially problematic updates, and skip major version updates.

## Current Context
- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Go Module File**: `go.mod` in repository root
- **NPM Packages**: Check for `@playwright/mcp` updates in constants.go

## Your Tasks

### Phase 0: Close Existing Dependency Issues (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)

**Before performing any analysis**, you must close existing open issues with the `[deps]` title prefix to prevent duplicate dependency update issues.

Use the GitHub API tools to:
1. Search for open issues with title starting with `[deps]` in repository ${{ github.repository }}
2. Close each found issue with a comment explaining that a new dependency check is being performed
3. Use the `close_issue` safe output to close these issues with reason "not_planned"

**Important**: The `close-issue` safe output is configured with:
- `required-title-prefix: "[deps]"` - Only issues starting with this prefix will be closed
- `target: "*"` - Can close any issue by number (not just triggering issue)
- `max: 20` - Can close up to 20 issues in one run

To close an existing dependency issue, emit:
```
close_issue(issue_number=123, body="Closing this issue as a new dependency check is being performed.")
```

**Do not proceed to Phase 1 until all existing `[deps]` issues are closed.**

### Phase 1: Check Dependabot Alerts
1. Use the Dependabot toolset to check for available dependency updates for the `go.mod` file
2. Retrieve the list of alerts and update recommendations from Dependabot
3. For each potential update, gather:
   - Current version and proposed version
   - Type of update (patch, minor, major)
   - Security vulnerability information (if any)
   - Changelog or release notes (if available via web-fetch)

### Phase 1.5: Check Playwright NPM Package Updates
1. Check the current `@playwright/mcp` version in `pkg/constants/constants.go`:
   - Look for `DefaultPlaywrightVersion` constant
   - Extract the current version number
2. Check for newer versions on NPM:
   - Use web-fetch to query `https://registry.npmjs.org/@playwright/mcp`
   - Compare the latest version with the current version in constants.go
   - Get release information and changelog if available
3. Evaluate the update:
   - Check if it's a patch, minor, or major version update
   - Look for breaking changes in release notes
   - Consider security fixes and improvements

### Phase 2: Categorize Updates (Three-Tier Strategy)
For each dependency update, categorize it into one of three categories:

**Category A: Safe Patches** (group into ONE consolidated issue):
- Patch version updates ONLY (e.g., v1.2.3 → v1.2.4)
- Single-version increments (not multi-version jumps like v1.2.3 → v1.2.5)
- Bug fixes and stability improvements only (no new features)
- No breaking changes or behavior modifications
- Security patches that only fix vulnerabilities without API changes
- Explicitly backward compatible per changelog

**Category B: Potentially Problematic** (create INDIVIDUAL issues):
- Minor version updates (e.g., v1.2.x → v1.3.x)
- Multi-version jumps in patch versions (e.g., v1.2.3 → v1.2.7)
- Updates with new features or API additions
- Updates with behavior changes mentioned in changelog
- Updates that require configuration or code changes
- Security updates that include API changes
- Any update where safety is uncertain

**Category C: Skip** (do NOT create issues):
- Major version updates (e.g., v1.x.x → v2.x.x)
- Updates with breaking changes explicitly mentioned
- Updates requiring significant refactoring
- Updates with insufficient documentation to assess safety

### Phase 2.5: Repository Detection
Before creating issues, determine the actual source repository for each Go module:

**GitHub Packages** (`github.com/*`):
- Remove version suffixes like `/v2`, `/v3`, `/v4` from the module path
- Example: `github.com/spf13/cobra/v2` → repository is `github.com/spf13/cobra`
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}`
- Release URL: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases/tag/{version}`

**golang.org/x Packages**:
- These are NOT hosted on GitHub
- Repository: `https://go.googlesource.com/{package-name}`
- Example: `golang.org/x/sys` → `https://go.googlesource.com/sys`
- Commit history: `https://go.googlesource.com/{package-name}/+log`
- Do NOT link to GitHub release pages (they don't exist)

**Other Packages**:
- Use `pkg.go.dev/{module-path}` to find the repository URL
- Look for the "Repository" or "Source" link on the package page
- Use the discovered repository for links

### Phase 3: Create Issues Based on Categorization

**For Category A (Safe Patches)**: Create ONE consolidated issue grouping all safe patch updates together.

**For Category B (Potentially Problematic)**: Create INDIVIDUAL issues for each update.

**For Category C**: Do not create any issues.

#### Consolidated Issue Format (Category A)

**Title**: "Update safe patch dependencies (N updates)"

**Body** should include:
- **Summary**: Brief overview of grouped safe patch updates
- **Updates Table**: Table listing all safe patch updates with columns:
  - Package name
  - Current version
  - Proposed version
  - Key changes
- **Safety Assessment**: Why all these updates are considered safe patches
- **Recommended Action**: Single command block to apply all updates at once
- **Testing Notes**: General testing guidance

#### Individual Issue Format (Category B)

**Title**: Short description of the specific update (e.g., "Update github.com/spf13/cobra from v1.9.1 to v1.10.0")

**Body** should include:
- **Summary**: Brief description of what needs to be updated
- **Current Version**: The version currently in go.mod
- **Proposed Version**: The version to update to
- **Update Type**: Minor/Multi-version patch jump
- **Why Separate Issue**: Clear explanation of why this update needs individual review (e.g., "Minor version update with new features", "Multi-version jump requires careful testing", "Behavior changes mentioned in changelog")
- **Safety Assessment**: Detailed assessment of risks and considerations
- **Changes**: Summary of changes from changelog or release notes
- **Links**: 
  - Link to the Dependabot alert (if applicable)
  - Link to the actual source repository (detected per Repository Detection rules)
  - Link to release notes or changelog (if available)
  - For GitHub packages: link to release page
  - For golang.org/x packages: link to commit history instead
- **Recommended Action**: Command to update (e.g., `go get -u github.com/package@v1.10.0`)
- **Testing Notes**: Specific areas to test after applying the update

## Important Notes
- Do NOT apply updates directly - only create issues describing what should be updated
- Use three-tier categorization: Group Category A (safe patches), individual issues for Category B (potentially problematic), skip Category C (major versions)
- Category A updates should be grouped into ONE consolidated issue with a table format
- Category B updates should each get their own issue with a "Why Separate Issue" explanation
- If no safe updates are found, exit without creating any issues
- Limit to a maximum of 10 issues per run (up to 1 grouped issue for Category A + remaining individual issues for Category B)
- For security-related updates, clearly indicate the vulnerability being fixed
- Be conservative: when in doubt about breaking changes or behavior modifications, categorize as Category B (individual issue) or Category C (skip)
- When categorizing, prioritize safety: only true single-version patch updates with bug fixes belong in Category A

**CRITICAL - Repository Detection**:
- **Never assume all Go packages are on GitHub**
- **golang.org/x packages** are hosted at `go.googlesource.com`, NOT GitHub
- **Always remove version suffixes** (e.g., `/v2`, `/v3`) when constructing repository URLs for GitHub packages
- **Use pkg.go.dev** to find the actual repository for packages not on GitHub or golang.org/x
- **Do NOT create GitHub release links** for packages that don't use GitHub releases

## Example Issue Formats
