# Daily News

Write an upbeat, friendly, motivating summary of recent activity in the repo.

## 📁 Pre-Downloaded Data Available

**IMPORTANT**: All GitHub data has been pre-downloaded to `/tmp/gh-aw/daily-news-data/` to avoid excessive MCP calls. Use these files instead of making GitHub API calls:

- **`issues.json`** - Open and recently closed issues (last 100 of each)
- **`pull_requests.json`** - Open, merged, and closed pull requests
- **`commits.json`** - Recent commits (up to last 100)
- **`releases.json`** - All releases
- **`discussions.json`** - Recent discussions (last 50)
- **`changesets.txt`** - List of changeset files (if directory exists)

**Load and analyze these files** instead of making repeated GitHub MCP calls. All data is in JSON format (except changesets.txt which lists file paths).

## 💾 Repo Memory Available

**Repo-memory is enabled** - You have access to persistent storage at `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/default/` that persists across workflow runs:

- Use it to **store intermediate analysis results** that might be useful for future runs
- Store **processed data, statistics, or insights** that take time to compute
- Cache **expensive computations** like trend analysis or aggregated metrics
- Files stored here will be available in the next workflow run via Git branches

**Example use cases**:
- Save aggregated statistics (e.g., `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/default/monthly-stats.json`)
- Cache processed trend data for faster chart generation
- Store analysis results that can inform future reports

## 📊 Trend Charts Requirement

**IMPORTANT**: Generate exactly 2 trend charts that showcase key metrics of the project. These charts should visualize trends over time to give the team insights into project health and activity patterns.

Use the pre-downloaded data from `/tmp/gh-aw/daily-news-data/` to generate all statistics and charts.

### Chart Generation Process

**Phase 1: Data Collection**

**Use the pre-downloaded data files** from `/tmp/gh-aw/daily-news-data/`:

1. **Issues Activity Data**: Load from `issues.json`
   - Parse `openIssues.nodes` and `closedIssues.nodes`
   - Extract `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `closedAt` timestamps
   - Aggregate by day to count opens/closes
   - Calculate running count of open issues

2. **Pull Requests Activity Data**: Load from `pull_requests.json`
   - Parse `openPRs.nodes`, `mergedPRs.nodes`, `closedPRs.nodes`
   - Extract `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `mergedAt`, `closedAt` timestamps
   - Aggregate by day to count opens/merges/closes

3. **Commit Activity Data**: Load from `commits.json`
   - Parse commit array
   - Extract `date` (commit.author.date) timestamps
   - Aggregate by day to count commits
   - Count unique authors per day

4. **Additional Context** (optional):
   - Load discussions from `discussions.json`
   - Load releases from `releases.json`
   - Read changeset files listed in `changesets.txt`

**Phase 2: Data Preparation**

1. Create a Python script at `/tmp/gh-aw/python/process_data.py` that:
   - Reads the JSON files from `/tmp/gh-aw/daily-news-data/`
   - Processes timestamps and aggregates by date
   - Generates CSV files in `/tmp/gh-aw/python/data/`:
     - `issues_prs_activity.csv` - Daily counts of issues and PRs
     - `commit_activity.csv` - Daily commit counts and contributors

2. Execute the Python script to generate the CSVs

**Guardrails**:
- **Maximum issues to process**: 200 (100 open + 100 closed from pre-downloaded data)
- **Maximum PRs to process**: 130 (50 open + 50 merged + 30 closed from pre-downloaded data)
- **Maximum commits to process**: 100 (from pre-downloaded data)
- **Date range**: Last 30 days from the data available
- If data is sparse, use what's available and note it in the analysis

**Phase 3: Chart Generation**

Generate exactly **2 high-quality trend charts**:

**Chart 1: Issues & Pull Requests Activity**
- Multi-line chart showing:
  - Issues opened (line)
  - Issues closed (line)
  - PRs opened (line)
  - PRs merged (line)
- X-axis: Date (last 30 days)
- Y-axis: Count
- Include a 7-day moving average overlay if data is noisy
- Save as: `/tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/issues_prs_trends.png`

**Chart 2: Commit Activity & Contributors**
- Dual-axis chart or stacked visualization showing:
  - Daily commit count (bar chart or line)
  - Number of unique contributors (line with markers)
- X-axis: Date (last 30 days)
- Y-axis: Count
- Save as: `/tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/commit_trends.png`

**Chart Quality Requirements**:
- DPI: 300 minimum
- Figure size: 12x7 inches for better readability
- Use seaborn styling with a professional color palette
- Include grid lines for easier reading
- Clear, large labels and legend
- Title with context (e.g., "Issues & PR Activity - Last 30 Days")
- Annotations for significant peaks or patterns

**Phase 4: Upload Charts**

1. Upload both charts using the `upload asset` tool
2. Collect the returned URLs for embedding in the discussion

**Phase 5: Embed Charts in Discussion**

Include the charts in your daily news discussion report with this structure:

```markdown
## 📈 Trend Analysis

### Issues & Pull Requests Activity
![Issues and PR Trends](URL_FROM_UPLOAD_ASSET_CHART_1)

[Brief 2-3 sentence analysis of the trends shown in this chart, highlighting notable patterns, increases, decreases, or insights]

### Commit Activity & Contributors
![Commit Activity Trends](URL_FROM_UPLOAD_ASSET_CHART_2)

[Brief 2-3 sentence analysis of the trends shown in this chart, noting developer engagement, busy periods, or collaboration patterns]
```

### Python Implementation Notes

- Use pandas for data manipulation and date handling
- Use matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for visualization
- Set appropriate date formatters for x-axis labels
- Use `plt.xticks(rotation=45)` for readable date labels
- Apply `plt.tight_layout()` before saving
- Handle cases where data might be sparse or missing

### Error Handling

If insufficient data is available (less than 7 days):
- Generate the charts with available data
- Add a note in the analysis mentioning the limited data range
- Consider using a bar chart instead of line chart for very sparse data

---

**Data Sources** - Use the pre-downloaded files in `/tmp/gh-aw/daily-news-data/`:
- Include some or all of the following from the JSON files:
  * Recent issues activity (from `issues.json`)
  * Recent pull requests (from `pull_requests.json`)
  * Recent discussions (from `discussions.json`)
  * Recent releases (from `releases.json`)
  * Recent code changes (from `commits.json`)
  * Changesets (from `changesets.txt` file list)

- If little has happened, don't write too much.

- Give some deep thought to ways the team can improve their productivity, and suggest some ways to do that.

- Include a description of open source community engagement, if any.

- Highlight suggestions for possible investment, ideas for features and project plan, ways to improve community engagement, and so on.

- Be helpful, thoughtful, respectful, positive, kind, and encouraging.

- Use emojis to make the report more engaging and fun, but don't overdo it.

- Include a short haiku at the end of the report to help orient the team to the season of their work.

## 📝 Report Formatting Guidelines

Follow these formatting guidelines to create well-structured, readable news reports:

### 1. Header Levels
**Use h3 (###) or lower for all headers in your news report to maintain proper document hierarchy.**

When creating your news report:
- Use `###` (h3) for main sections (e.g., "### Top News", "### Trend Analysis")
- Use `####` (h4) for subsections (e.g., "#### Recent Releases", "#### Community Engagement")
- Never use `##` (h2) or `#` (h1) in the report body - these are reserved for titles

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
**Wrap detailed news analysis and long article sections in `<details><summary><b>Section Name</b></summary>` tags to improve readability.**

Use collapsible sections for:
- Detailed article analysis
- Verbose commit logs or detailed change descriptions
- Additional news items that provide extra context
- Extended lists of issues or pull requests

Always keep critical information visible:
- Brief summary of top news items
- Key headlines with links
- High-level trend insights
- Important recommendations or takeaways

Example structure:
```markdown
<details>
<summary><b>Full News Analysis</b></summary>

[Long detailed content here...]

</details>
```

### 3. Suggested Report Structure

Structure your news report with these sections:

1. **Brief Summary** (always visible): 1-2 paragraphs highlighting the most important news
2. **Key Headlines** (always visible): Top 3-5 headlines with links to issues/PRs/releases
3. **📈 Trend Analysis** (always visible): Include the 2 required charts with brief analysis
4. **Detailed Article Analysis** (in `<details>` tags): Deep dive into specific items
5. **Additional News Items** (in `<details>` tags): Secondary stories and updates
6. **Recommendations & Takeaways** (always visible): Actionable insights for the team

### Design Principles

Your reports should:
- **Build trust through clarity**: Most important info immediately visible
- **Exceed expectations**: Add helpful context, summaries, and insights
- **Create delight**: Use progressive disclosure to reduce overwhelm
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow the same patterns as other reporting workflows

- In a note at the end of the report, include a log of:
  * All web search queries you used (if any)
  * All files you read from `/tmp/gh-aw/daily-news-data/`
  * Summary statistics: number of issues/PRs/commits/discussions analyzed
  * Date range of data analyzed
  * Any data limitations encountered

Create a new GitHub discussion with a title containing today's date (e.g., "Daily Status - 2024-10-10") containing a markdown report with your findings. Use links where appropriate.

Only a new discussion should be created, do not close or update any existing discussions.
