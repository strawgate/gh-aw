## Adding Workflows

Install workflows from external repositories with optional versioning:

```bash wrap
gh aw add githubnext/agentics/ci-doctor              # short form
gh aw add githubnext/agentics/ci-doctor@v1.0.0       # with version
gh aw add githubnext/agentics/workflows/ci-doctor.md # explicit path
```

Use `--name`, `--pr`, `--force`, `--engine`, or `--verbose` flags to customize installation. The `source` field is automatically added to workflow frontmatter for tracking origin and enabling updates.

## Updating Workflows

When you add a workflow, a tracking `source:` entry remembers where it came from. You can keep workflows synchronized with their source repositories:

```bash wrap
gh aw update                           # update all workflows
gh aw update ci-doctor                 # update specific workflow
gh aw update ci-doctor issue-triage    # update multiple
```

Use `--major`, `--force`, `--engine`, or `--verbose` flags to control update behavior. Semantic versions (e.g., `v1.2.3`) update to latest compatible release within same major version. Branch references update to latest commit. Updates use 3-way merge; when conflicts occur, manually resolve conflict markers and run `gh aw compile`.

## Imports

Import reusable components using the `imports:` field in frontmatter. File paths are relative to the workflow location:

```yaml wrap
---
on: issues
engine: copilot
imports:
  - shared/common-tools.md
  - shared/security-setup.md
  - shared/mcp/tavily.md
---
```

During `gh aw add`, imports are expanded to track source repository (e.g., `shared/common-tools.md` becomes `githubnext/agentics/shared/common-tools.md@abc123def`).

Remote imports are automatically cached in `.github/aw/imports/` by commit SHA. This enables offline workflow compilation once imports have been downloaded. The cache is shared across different refs pointing to the same commit, reducing redundant downloads.

### Import Merge Behavior

The compiler uses a **breadth-first search (BFS)** algorithm to process imports:

1. **Queueing**: Main workflow's direct imports are added to queue
2. **Processing**: Each import is loaded, parsed, and its configuration extracted
3. **Recursion**: Nested imports from imported files are added to queue
4. **Cycle Detection**: Already-processed files are skipped to prevent infinite loops
5. **Merging**: Configurations are merged according to field-specific rules
6. **Validation**: Final merged configuration is validated for conflicts

**Processing order** follows BFS traversal:
```
Main Workflow
├── shared/tools.md        (1st - direct import)
│   └── shared/base.md     (3rd - nested from tools.md)
└── shared/mcp.md          (2nd - direct import)
    └── shared/network.md  (4th - nested from mcp.md)
```

**Merge semantics by field**:

| Field | Merge Strategy | Main Workflow Precedence |
|-------|---------------|-------------------------|
| `tools:` | Deep merge, arrays concatenate | Keys merged, arrays deduplicated |
| `mcp-servers:` | Override by name | ❌ Imported servers override |
| `network:` | Union of allowed domains | ✅ Mode and firewall settings |
| `permissions:` | Validation only | ✅ Main must explicitly declare |
| `safe-outputs:` | Type-level override | ✅ Main overrides imported types |
| `safe-outputs.jobs:` | Conflict detection | Neither (names must be unique) |
| `runtimes:` | Version override | ✅ Main versions override |
| `services:` | Conflict detection | Neither (must be unique) |
| `steps:` | Array prepend | Imported first, then main |
| `jobs:` | Not importable | ✅ Main only (ignored in imports) |

**Example: Tool merging**
```yaml wrap
# shared/tools.md
tools:
  bash:
    allowed: [read, list]
  github:
    toolsets: [issues]

# main.md imports shared/tools.md
tools:
  bash:
    allowed: [write]  # Result: [read, list, write]
  web-fetch: {}       # Added to merged tools
```

**Example: Safe output overriding**
```yaml wrap
# shared/outputs.md
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[shared] "

# main.md imports shared/outputs.md
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[main] "  # Overrides imported config
```

## Importing Agents from Repositories

Agent files provide specialized AI instructions and behavior. You can import agents from external repositories to reuse expert-crafted prompts and configurations across teams and projects.

### Creating a Shareable Agent

Store agent files in `.github/agents/` of any repository:

```markdown title="acme-org/ai-agents/.github/agents/code-reviewer.md"
---
name: Expert Code Reviewer
description: Specialized agent for comprehensive code review with security focus
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [pull_requests, repos]
---

# Code Review Instructions

You are an expert code reviewer with deep knowledge of:
- Security best practices and OWASP guidelines
- Performance optimization patterns
- Code maintainability and readability
- Testing strategies and coverage

When reviewing code:
1. Identify security vulnerabilities first
2. Check for performance issues
3. Ensure code follows team conventions
4. Suggest specific improvements with examples
```

### Importing Remote Agents

Reference the agent using `owner/repo/path@version` format:

```yaml wrap
---
on: pull_request
engine: copilot
imports:
  - acme-org/ai-agents/.github/agents/code-reviewer.md@v1.2.0
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
---

# PR Review Workflow
The code reviewer agent will analyze this pull request and provide detailed feedback.
```

### Agent Versioning

Use semantic versioning for production stability:

```yaml wrap
imports:
  - acme-org/ai-agents/.github/agents/security-auditor.md@v2.0.0  # Production
  - acme-org/ai-agents/.github/agents/performance.md@main         # Latest
  - acme-org/ai-agents/.github/agents/custom.md@abc123def         # Immutable
```

### Agent Collections

Organizations can maintain libraries of specialized agents:

```
acme-org/ai-agents/
└── .github/
    └── agents/
        ├── code-reviewer.md         # General code review
        ├── security-auditor.md      # Security-focused analysis
        ├── performance-analyst.md   # Performance optimization
        ├── accessibility-checker.md # WCAG compliance
        └── documentation-writer.md  # Technical documentation
```

Teams import agents based on workflow needs, with all agents benefiting from centralized updates and versioning.

## Example: Modular Workflow with Imports

Create a shared Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configuration in `.github/workflows/shared/mcp/tavily.md`:

```yaml wrap
---
mcp-servers:
  tavily:
    url: "https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=${{ secrets.TAVILY_API_KEY }}"
    allowed: ["*"]
network:
  allowed:
    - mcp.tavily.com
---
```

Reference it in your workflow to include the Tavily MCP server alongside other tools:

```yaml wrap
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
imports:
  - shared/mcp/tavily.md
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues]
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
---

# Research Agent
Perform web research using Tavily and respond to issues.
```

**Result**: The compiled workflow includes both the Tavily MCP server from the import and the GitHub tools from the main workflow, with network permissions automatically merged to allow access to both `mcp.tavily.com` and GitHub API endpoints.

## Real-World Scenario: Team-Wide Configuration

A development team can create a shared configuration repository with reusable components:

```
acme-org/workflow-library/
├── .github/
│   └── agents/
│       ├── code-reviewer.md         # Specialized code review agent
│       ├── security-auditor.md      # Security-focused agent
│       └── performance-analyst.md   # Performance optimization agent
├── shared/
│   ├── tools/
│   │   ├── github-standard.md       # Standard GitHub API toolsets
│   │   └── code-analysis.md         # Code quality tools
│   ├── mcp/
│   │   ├── tavily.md                # Web search
│   │   └── database.md              # Database access
│   └── config/
│       ├── security-policies.md     # Security constraints
│       └── notification-setup.md    # Notification settings
└── workflows/
    ├── issue-triage.md
    ├── pr-review.md
    └── release-automation.md
```

Individual workflows import required components and agents:

```yaml wrap
---
on: pull_request
engine: copilot
imports:
  - acme-org/workflow-library/.github/agents/code-reviewer.md@v2.0.0
  - acme-org/workflow-library/shared/tools/github-standard.md@v2.0.0
  - acme-org/workflow-library/shared/tools/code-analysis.md@v2.0.0
  - acme-org/workflow-library/shared/config/security-policies.md@v2.0.0
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request-review-comment:
    max: 10
---

# Code Review Agent
Automated code review with security policy enforcement using shared agent.
```

**Benefits**:
- **Consistency**: All workflows use same tool configurations and agent behavior
- **Maintainability**: Update imports once, affects all workflows
- **Versioning**: Pin to stable versions with semantic tags
- **Modularity**: Mix and match components and agents as needed
- **Governance**: Security policies and review standards enforced through imports
- **Agent Sharing**: Reuse specialized agent instructions across teams and repositories

## Specification Formats and Validation

Workflow and import specifications require minimum 3 parts (owner/repo/path) for remote imports. Explicit paths must end with `.md`. Versions can be semantic tags (`@v1.0.0`), branches (`@develop`), or commit SHAs. Identifiers use alphanumeric characters with hyphens/underscores (cannot start/end with hyphen).

**Examples:**
- Repository: `owner/repo[@version]`
- Short workflow: `owner/repo/workflow[@version]` (adds `workflows/` prefix and `.md`)
- Explicit workflow: `owner/repo/path/to/workflow.md[@version]`
- Agent import: `owner/repo/.github/agents/agent-name.md[@version]`
- Shared import: `owner/repo/shared/tools/config.md[@version]`
- GitHub URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/workflows/ci-doctor.md`
- Raw URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owner/repo/refs/heads/main/workflows/ci-doctor.md`

## Best Practices

Use semantic versioning for stable workflows and agents, branches for development, and commit SHAs for immutability. Organize reusable components in `shared/` directories and agent files in `.github/agents/` with descriptive names. Review updates with `--verbose` before applying, test on branches, and keep local modifications minimal to reduce merge conflicts.

When sharing agents across teams:
- Use semantic versioning for production agents (`@v1.0.0`)
- Document agent capabilities and requirements in frontmatter
- Test agent updates in non-production workflows first
- Maintain backwards compatibility within major versions
