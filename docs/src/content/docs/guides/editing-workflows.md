title: Editing Workflows
description: Learn when you can edit workflows directly on GitHub.com versus when recompilation is required, and best practices for iterating on agentic workflows.

Agentic workflows consist of two distinct parts with different editing requirements: the **YAML frontmatter** (configuration) and the **markdown body** (AI instructions). Understanding when changes require recompilation helps you iterate quickly and efficiently.

See [Creating Agentic Workflows](/gh-aw/setup/creating-workflows/) for guidance on creating workflows with AI assistance.

## Overview

Workflow files (`.md`) are compiled into GitHub Actions workflow files (`.lock.yml`). The compilation process:

- **Embeds frontmatter** directly into the lock file (changes require recompilation)
- **Loads the markdown body** at runtime from the source file (changes do NOT require recompilation)

This design allows you to quickly iterate on AI instructions without recompilation while maintaining strict control over security-sensitive configuration.

## Editing Without Recompilation

> [!TIP]
> You can edit the **markdown body** directly on GitHub.com or in any editor without recompiling. Changes take effect on the next workflow run.

### What You Can Edit

The markdown body is loaded at runtime from the original `.md` file. You can freely edit:

- **AI instructions**: Task descriptions, step-by-step guidance, examples
- **Context explanations**: Project conventions, background information
- **Output formatting**: Templates for issues, PRs, comments
- **Conditional logic**: "If X, then do Y" instructions
- **Documentation**: Headers, examples, clarifications

### Workflow for Quick Iterations

```bash
# 1. Edit the markdown body on GitHub.com
#    Navigate to .github/workflows/my-workflow.md
#    Click "Edit" and modify instructions

# 2. Commit changes directly to main (or create PR)

# 3. Trigger the workflow
#    Changes are immediately active - no recompilation needed!
```

### Example: Adding Instructions

**Before** (in `.github/workflows/issue-triage.md`):
```markdown
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
---

# Issue Triage

Read issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} and add appropriate labels.
```

**After** (edited on GitHub.com):
```markdown
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
---

# Issue Triage

Read issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} and add appropriate labels.

## Labeling Criteria

Apply these labels based on content:
- `bug`: Issues describing incorrect behavior with reproduction steps
- `enhancement`: Feature requests or improvements
- `question`: Help requests or clarifications needed
- `documentation`: Documentation updates or corrections

For priority, consider:
- `high-priority`: Security issues, critical bugs, blocking issues
- `medium-priority`: Important features, non-critical bugs
- `low-priority`: Nice-to-have improvements, minor enhancements
```

✅ This change takes effect immediately without recompilation.

## Editing With Recompilation Required

> [!WARNING]
> Changes to the **YAML frontmatter** always require recompilation. These are security-sensitive configuration options.

### What Requires Recompilation

Any changes to the frontmatter configuration between `---` markers:

- **Triggers** (`on:`): Event types, filters, schedules
- **Permissions** (`permissions:`): Repository access levels
- **Tools** (`tools:`): Tool configurations, MCP servers, allowed tools
- **Network** (`network:`): Allowed domains, firewall rules
- **Safe outputs** (`safe-outputs:`): Output types, threat detection
- **Safe inputs** (`safe-inputs:`): Input validation rules
- **Runtimes** (`runtimes:`): Node, Python, Go version overrides
- **Imports** (`imports:`): Shared configuration files
- **Custom jobs** (`jobs:`): Additional workflow jobs
- **Engine** (`engine:`): AI engine selection (copilot, claude, codex)
- **Timeout** (`timeout-minutes:`): Maximum execution time
- **Roles** (`roles:`): Permission requirements for actors

### Example: Adding a Tool (Requires Recompilation)

**Before**:
```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

permissions:
  issues: write
---
```

**After** (must recompile):
```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

permissions:
  issues: write

tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues]
---
```

⚠️ Run `gh aw compile my-workflow` before committing this change.

## Expressions and Environment Variables

### Allowed Expressions

You can safely use these expressions in markdown without recompilation:

```markdown
# Process Issue

Read issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} in repository ${{ github.repository }}.

Issue title: "${{ github.event.issue.title }}"

Use sanitized content: "${{ needs.activation.outputs.text }}"

Actor: ${{ github.actor }}
Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
```

These expressions are evaluated at runtime and validated for security. See [Templating](/gh-aw/reference/templating/) for the complete list of allowed expressions.

### Prohibited Expressions

Arbitrary expressions are blocked for security. This will fail at runtime:

```markdown
# ❌ WRONG - Will be rejected
Run this command: ${{ github.event.comment.body }}
```

Use `needs.activation.outputs.text` for sanitized user input instead.
