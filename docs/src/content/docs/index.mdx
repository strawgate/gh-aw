Imagine a world where improvements to your repositories are automatically delivered as pull requests each morning, ready for you to review. Issues are automatically triaged, CI failures analyzed, documentation maintained, test coverage improved and compliance monitored. All defined via simple markdown files.

GitHub Agentic Workflows deliver this: repository automation, running the coding agents you know and love, in GitHub Actions, with strong guardrails and security-first design principles.

Use GitHub Copilot, Claude by Anthropic or OpenAI Codex for event-triggered, recurring and scheduled jobs to improve, document and analyze your repository. GitHub Agentic Workflows are designed to [augment](https://github.github.io/gh-aw/reference/faq/#determinism) your existing, deterministic CI/CD with [Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai) capabilities

Developed by GitHub Next and Microsoft Research with guardrails in mind, agentic workflows run with minimal permissions by default, with explicit allowlisting for write operations and sandboxed execution to help keep your repository safe.

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub Agentic Workflows is in early development and may change significantly. Using agentic workflows requires careful attention to security considerations and careful human supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk.

### Guardrails Built-In

Workflows run with read-only permissions by default. Write operations require explicit approval through sanitized [safe outputs](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#safe-outputs) (pre-approved GitHub operations), with sandboxed execution, tool allowlisting, and network isolation ensuring AI agents operate within controlled boundaries.

## Example: Daily Issues Report

Here's a simple workflow that runs daily to create an upbeat status report:

```markdown
---
on:
  schedule: daily
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: read
  pull-requests: read
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[team-status] "
    labels: [report, daily-status]
    close-older-issues: true
---

## Daily Issues Report

Create an upbeat daily status report for the team as a GitHub issue.
```

The `gh aw` cli augments this with a [lock file](/gh-aw/reference/faq/#what-is-a-workflow-lock-file) for a GitHub Actions Workflow (.lock.yml) that runs an AI agent (Copilot, Claude, Codex, ...) in a containerized environment on a schedule or manually.

The AI coding agent reads your repository context, analyzes issues, generates visualizations, and creates reports. All defined in natural language rather than complex code.
