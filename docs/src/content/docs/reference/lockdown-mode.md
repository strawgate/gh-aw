**GitHub lockdown mode** is [a security feature of the GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/server-configuration.md#lockdown-mode) that filters content in public repositories to only surface items (issues, pull requests, comments, discussions, etc.) from users with **push access** to the repository. This protects agentic workflows from processing potentially malicious or misleading content from untrusted users.

> [!TIP]
> **Automatic Protection**: GitHub lockdown mode is **automatically enabled** for public repositories. This provides secure defaults without manual configuration.

## Security Benefits

GitHub lockdown mode protects against several attack vectors:

### Input Manipulation

Without lockdown, an attacker could:

1. Create an issue with malicious code snippets or links
2. Trigger an agentic workflow (e.g., issue triage, planning assistant)
3. Attempt to hijack the workflow through prompt-injection

**With lockdown**: Only trusted contributors' issues are visible to workflows.

### Context Poisoning

Attackers could flood public repositories with spam issues to:
- Overwhelm the AI context window with noise
- Manipulate AI decisions through volume of malicious suggestions
- Exhaust rate limits or credits

**With lockdown**: Only legitimate contributor content consumes workflow resources.

### Social Engineering

Malicious users could craft issues that:
- Impersonate maintainers
- Request sensitive information
- Trick AI into revealing secrets or internal data

**With lockdown**: Only verified contributors can interact with workflows.

## Configuration

### Automatic Mode (Recommended)

Lockdown is automatically determined based on repository visibility:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  github:
    mode: remote
    toolsets: [repos, issues, pull_requests]
    # Lockdown automatically enabled for public repos
    # Automatically disabled for private/internal repos
```

### Manual Override

Explicitly enable or disable lockdown for specific workflows:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  github:
    lockdown: true   # Force enable (use in public repos to ensure protection)
    # or
    lockdown: false  # Explicitly disable (see "When to Disable" below)
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Consideration**: Setting `lockdown: false` in public repositories allows workflows to process content from any GitHub user. Only use this for workflows specifically designed to handle untrusted input safely.

## When to Disable Lockdown

Some workflows are **designed** to process content from all users and include appropriate safety controls. Safe use cases for `lockdown: false` in public repositories:

- **Issue Triage**: Workflows that label, categorize, or route issues from all users
- **Issue Organization**: Workflows that add issues to projects or milestones based on labels or content
- **Issue Planning**: Workflows that estimate complexity, suggest related issues, or draft implementation plans based on issue content
- **Spam Detection**: Workflows that identify and flag spam issues or comments
- **Public Dashboards**: Workflows that generate public reports or metrics based on all repository activity
- **Command Workflows**: Workflows that respond to specific commands in issue comments (e.g., `/plan`, `/analyze`) and verify user permissions before taking action
