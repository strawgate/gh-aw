> [!NOTE]
> GitHub Agentic Workflows is in early development and may change significantly. Using automated agentic workflows requires careful attention to security considerations and careful human supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk.

## Determinism

### I like deterministic CI/CD. Isn't this non-deterministic?

Agentic workflows are **100% additive** to your existing CI/CD - they don't replace your deterministic build, test, or release pipelines. Think of it as **Continuous AI** alongside Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment: a new automation layer running in GitHub Actions where security, permissions, and repository context already exist.

Your deterministic pipelines stay unchanged. Agentic workflows handle tasks where exact reproducibility doesn't matter - triaging issues, drafting documentation, researching dependencies, or proposing code improvements for human review.

## Capabilities

### What's the difference between agentic workflows and regular GitHub Actions workflows?

Agentic workflows use AI to interpret natural language instructions in markdown instead of complex YAML. The AI engine can call pre-approved tools to perform tasks while running with read-only default permissions, safe outputs, and sandboxed execution.

### What's the difference between agentic workflows and just running a coding agent in GitHub Actions?

While you could install and run a coding agent directly in a standard GitHub Actions workflow, agentic workflows provide a structured framework with simpler markdown format, built-in security controls, pre-defined tools for GitHub operations, and easy switching between AI engines.

### Can agentic workflows write code and create pull requests?

Yes! Agentic workflows can create pull requests using the `create-pull-request` safe output. This allows the workflow to propose code changes, documentation updates, or other modifications as pull requests for human review and merging.

Some organizations may completely disable the creation of pull requests from GitHub Actions. In such cases, workflows can still generate diffs or suggestions in issues or comments for manual application.

### Can agentic workflows do more than code?

Yes! Agentic workflows can analyze repositories, generate reports, triage issues, research information, create documentation, and coordinate work. The AI interprets natural language instructions and uses available [tools](/gh-aw/reference/tools/) to accomplish tasks.

### Can agentic workflows mix regular GitHub Actions steps with AI agentic steps?

Yes! Agentic workflows can include both AI agentic steps and traditional GitHub Actions steps. You can add custom steps before the agentic job using the [`steps:` configuration](/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/#custom-steps-steps). Additionally, [custom safe output jobs](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/#custom-safe-output-jobs-jobs) can be used as consumers of agentic outputs. [MCP Scripts](/gh-aw/reference/mcp-scripts/) allow you to pass data between traditional steps and the AI agent with added checking.

### Can agentic workflows read other repositories?

Not by default, but yes with proper configuration. Cross-repository access requires:

1. A **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with access to target repositories
2. Configuring the token in your workflow

See [MultiRepoOps](/gh-aw/patterns/multi-repo-ops/) for coordinating across repositories, or [SideRepoOps](/gh-aw/patterns/side-repo-ops/) for running workflows from a separate repository.

### Can I use agentic workflows in private repositories?

Yes, and in many cases we recommend it. Private repositories are ideal for proprietary code, creating a "sidecar" repository with limited access, testing workflows, and organization-internal automation. See [SideRepoOps](/gh-aw/patterns/side-repo-ops/) for patterns using private repositories.

### Can I edit workflows directly on GitHub.com without recompiling?

Yes! The **markdown body** (AI instructions) is loaded at runtime and can be edited directly on GitHub.com or in any editor. Changes take effect on the next workflow run without recompilation.

However, **frontmatter configuration** (tools, permissions, triggers, network rules) is embedded in the compiled workflow and requires recompilation when changed. Run `gh aw compile my-workflow` after editing frontmatter.

See [Editing Workflows](/gh-aw/guides/editing-workflows/) for complete guidance on when recompilation is needed.

### Can workflows trigger other workflows?

Yes, using the `dispatch-workflow` safe output:

```yaml wrap
safe-outputs:
  dispatch-workflow:
    max: 1
```

This allows your workflow to trigger up to 1 other workflows with custom inputs. See [Safe Outputs](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/#workflow-dispatch-dispatch-workflow) for details.

### Can I use MCP servers with agentic workflows?

Yes! [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#mcp-model-context-protocol) servers extend workflow capabilities with custom tools and integrations. Configure them in your frontmatter:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  mcp-servers:
    my-server:
      image: "ghcr.io/org/my-mcp-server:latest"
      network:
        allowed: ["api.example.com"]
```

See [Getting Started with MCP](/gh-aw/guides/getting-started-mcp/) and [MCP Servers](/gh-aw/guides/mcps/) for configuration guides.

### Can workflows be broken up into shareable components?

Workflows can import shared configurations and components:

```yaml wrap
imports:
  - shared/github-tools.md
  - githubnext/agentics/shared/common-tools.md
```

This enables reusable tool configurations, network settings, and permissions across workflows. See [Imports](/gh-aw/reference/imports/) and [Packaging Imports](/gh-aw/guides/packaging-imports/) for details.

### Can I run workflows on a schedule?

Yes, use cron expressions in the `on:` trigger:

```yaml wrap
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * MON"  # Every Monday at 9am UTC
```

See [Schedule Syntax](/gh-aw/reference/schedule-syntax/) for cron expression reference.

### Can I run workflows conditionally?

Yes, use the `if:` expression at the workflow level:

```yaml wrap
if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

See [Conditional Execution](/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/#conditional-execution-if) in the Frontmatter Reference for details.

## Guardrails

### Agentic workflows run in GitHub Actions. Can they access my repository secrets?

Repository secrets are not available to the agentic step by default. The AI agent runs with read-only permissions and cannot directly access your repository secrets unless explicitly configured. You should review workflows carefully, follow [GitHub Actions security guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/secure-use), use least-privilege permissions, and inspect the compiled `.lock.yml` file. See the [Security Architectur](/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/) for details.

Some MCP tools may be configured using secrets, but these are only accessible to the specific tool steps, not the AI agent itself. Minimize the use of tools equipped with highly privileged secrets.

### Agentic workflows run in GitHub Actions. Can they write to the repository?

By default, the agentic "coding agent" step of agentic workflows runs with read-only permissions. Write operations require explicit approval through [safe outputs](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/) or explicit general `write` permissions (not recommended). This ensures that AI agents cannot make arbitrary changes to your repository.

If safe outputs are configured, the workflow has limited, highly specific write operations that are then sanitized and executed securely.

### What sanitization is done on AI outputs before applying changes?

All safe outputs from the AI agent are sanitized before being applied to your repository. Sanitization includes secret redaction, URL domain filtering, XML escaping, size limits, control character stripping, GitHub reference escaping and HTTPS enforcement.

Additionally, safe outputs enforce permission separation - write operations happen in separate jobs with scoped permissions, never in the agentic job itself.

See [Safe Outputs - Text Sanitization](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/#text-sanitization-allowed-domains-allowed-github-references) for configuration options.

### How do I prevent workflow output from creating backlinks in referenced issues?

When AI-generated content mentions issue or PR numbers (such as `#123` or `owner/repo#456`), GitHub automatically creates "mentioned in..." timeline entries in those issues. Set `allowed-github-references: []` to escape all such references before the content is posted:

```yaml wrap
safe-outputs:
  allowed-github-references: []  # Escape all GitHub references
  create-issue:
```

With an empty list, every `#N` and `owner/repo#N` reference in the output is wrapped in backticks, which prevents GitHub from resolving them as cross-references and avoids cluttering other repositories' timelines. This is especially useful for [SideRepoOps](/gh-aw/patterns/side-repo-ops/) workflows that write content about issues in a main repository from a separate sidecar repository.

To allow references only from the current repository while still escaping all others:

```yaml wrap
safe-outputs:
  allowed-github-references: [repo]
  add-comment:
```

When `allowed-github-references` is not configured at all, all references are left unescaped (default behavior).

See [Text Sanitization](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/#text-sanitization-allowed-domains-allowed-github-references) for full configuration options.

### Tell me more about guardrails

Guardrails are foundational to the design. Agentic workflows implement defense-in-depth through compilation-time validation (schema checks, expression safety, action SHA pinning), runtime isolation (sandboxed containers with network controls), permission separation (read-only defaults with [safe outputs](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/) for writes), tool allowlisting, and output sanitization. See the [Security Architecture](/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/).

### How is my code and data processed?

By default, your workflow is run on GitHub Actions, like any other GitHub Actions workflow, and as one if its jobs it invokes your nominated [AI Engine (coding agent)](/gh-aw/reference/engines/), run in a container. This engine may in turn make tool calls and MCP calls. When using the default **GitHub Copilot CLI**, the workflow is processed by the `copilot` CLI tool which uses GitHub Copilot's services and related AI models. The specifics depend on your engine choice:

- **GitHub Copilot CLI**: See [GitHub Copilot documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot) for details.
- **Claude/Codex**: Uses respective providers' APIs with their data handling policies.

See the [Security Architecture](/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/) for details on the execution and data flow.

### Does the underlying AI engine run in a sandbox?

Yes, the [AI engine](/gh-aw/reference/engines/) runs in a containerized sandbox with network egress control via the [Agent Workflow Firewall](/gh-aw/reference/sandbox/), container isolation, GitHub Actions resource constraints, and limited filesystem access to workspace and temporary directories. The sandbox container runs inside a GitHub Actions VM for additional isolation. See [Sandbox Configuration](/gh-aw/reference/sandbox/).

### Can an agentic workflow use outbound network requests?

Yes, but network access is restricted by the [Agent Workflow Firewall](/gh-aw/reference/sandbox/). You must explicitly declare which domains the workflow can access:

```yaml wrap
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults             # Basic infrastructure
    - python               # Python/PyPI ecosystem
    - "api.example.com"    # Custom domain
```

See [Network Permissions](/gh-aw/reference/network/) for complete configuration options.

### What is GitHub lockdown mode and when is it enabled?

[GitHub lockdown mode](/gh-aw/reference/lockdown-mode/) is a security feature that filters content in public repositories to only show issues, pull requests, and comments from users with push access. This protects workflows from processing potentially malicious input from untrusted users.

Lockdown mode is **automatically enabled** for public repositories if [Additional Authentication for GitHub Tools](/gh-aw/reference/github-tools/#additional-authentication-for-github-tools) is configured. It is not in effect for private or internal repositories.

## Configuration & Setup

### What is a workflow lock file?

A **workflow lock file** (`.lock.yml`) is the compiled GitHub Actions workflow generated from your `.md` file by `gh aw compile`. It contains SHA-pinned actions, resolved imports, configured permissions, and all guardrail hardening - inspect it to see exactly what will run, with no hidden configuration.

Both files should be committed to version control:

- **`.md` file**: Your source - edit the prompt body freely; changes take effect at the next run without recompiling
- **`.lock.yml` file**: The compiled workflow GitHub Actions actually runs; must be regenerated after any frontmatter changes (permissions, tools, triggers)

### Why do I need a token or key?

When using **GitHub Copilot CLI**, a Personal Access Token (PAT) with "Copilot Requests" permission authenticates and associates automation work with your GitHub account. This ensures usage tracking against your subscription, appropriate AI permissions, and auditable actions. In the future, this may support organization-level association. See [Authentication](/gh-aw/reference/auth/).

### Can I use `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` with the Claude engine?

No. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is not supported by GitHub Agentic Workflows. The only supported authentication method for the Claude engine is [`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`](/gh-aw/reference/auth/#anthropic_api_key), which must be configured as a GitHub Actions secret. Provider-based OAuth authentication for Claude (such as billing through a Claude Teams subscription) is not supported. See [Authentication](/gh-aw/reference/auth/) and [AI Engines](/gh-aw/reference/engines/#available-coding-agents) for setup instructions.

### What hidden runtime dependencies does this have?

The executing agentic workflow uses your nominated coding agent (defaulting to GitHub Copilot CLI), a GitHub Actions VM with NodeJS, pinned Actions from [github/gh-aw](https://github.com/github/gh-aw) releases, and an Agent Workflow Firewall container for network control (optional but default). The exact YAML workflow can be inspected in the compiled `.lock.yml` file - there's no hidden configuration.

### Why are macOS runners not supported?

macOS runners (`macos-*`) are not currently supported in agentic workflows. Agentic workflows rely on containers to build a secure execution sandbox - specifically the [Agent Workflow Firewall](/gh-aw/reference/sandbox/) that provides network egress control and process isolation. GitHub-hosted macOS runners do not support container jobs, which is a hard requirement for this security architecture.

Use `ubuntu-latest` (the default) or another Linux-based runner instead. For tasks that genuinely require macOS-specific tooling, consider running those steps in a regular GitHub Actions job that coordinates with your agentic workflow.

### I'm not using a supported AI Engine (coding agent). What should I do?

If you want to use a coding agent that isn't currently supported (Copilot, Claude, or Codex), you can contribute support to the [gh-aw repository](https://github.com/github/gh-aw), or open an issue describing your use case. See [AI Engines](/gh-aw/reference/engines/).

### Can I test workflows without affecting my repository?

Yes! Use [TrialOps](/gh-aw/patterns/trial-ops/) to test workflows in isolated trial repositories. This lets you validate behavior and iterate on prompts without creating real issues, PRs, or comments in your actual repository.

### Where can I find help with common issues?

See [Common Issues](/gh-aw/troubleshooting/common-issues/) for detailed troubleshooting guidance including workflow failures, debugging strategies, permission issues, and network problems.

### Why is my create-discussion workflow failing with integration-forbidden?

Discussion creation requires announcement-capable categories. If your workflow fails with an `integration-forbidden` error, ensure the `category` field in your configuration specifies a category that has announcement capabilities enabled in your repository's discussion settings.

Common issues:
- **Non-announcement categories**: Only categories configured to support announcements can be used for automated discussion creation. Check your repository's discussion settings to verify which categories have announcement capabilities.
- **Category name typos**: Verify the category name spelling in your workflow configuration matches exactly with your repository's discussion categories. Category names are case-sensitive.
- **Category slugs**: Use lowercase category slugs (e.g., `general`, `announcements`) rather than display names for better reliability.

If discussions are not enabled or the category lacks announcement capabilities, consider using `fallback-to-issue: true` (the default) to automatically create an issue instead. See [Discussion Creation](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/#discussion-creation-create-discussion) for configuration details.

### Why is my create-pull-request workflow failing with "GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests"?

Some organizations block PR creation by GitHub Actions via **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**. If you can't enable it, use one of these alternatives:

**Automatic issue fallback (default)** — `fallback-as-issue: true` is the default; when PR creation is blocked an issue with the branch link is created instead. Requires `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, and `issues: write`.

**Assign to Copilot** — create an issue assigned to `copilot` for automated implementation:

```yaml wrap
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    assignees: [copilot]
    labels: [automation, enhancement]
```

**Disable fallback** — set `fallback-as-issue: false` to skip the issue fallback and only attempt PR creation. Requires only `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`, but the workflow will fail if PR creation is blocked.

See [Pull Request Creation](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/#pull-request-creation-create-pull-request) for details.

### Why don't pull requests created by agentic workflows trigger my CI checks?

This is expected GitHub Actions security behavior. Pull requests created using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` or by the GitHub Actions bot user **do not trigger workflow runs** on `pull_request`, `pull_request_target`, or `push` events. This is a [GitHub Actions security feature](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow) designed to prevent accidental recursive workflow execution.

The easy way to fix this problem is to set a secret `GH_AW_CI_TRIGGER_TOKEN` with a Personal Access Token (PAT) with 'Contents: Read & Write' permission to your repo.

See [Triggering CI](/gh-aw/reference/triggering-ci/) for more details on how to configure workflows to run CI checks on PRs created by agentic workflows.

### How do I suppress the "Generated by..." text in workflow outputs?

When workflows create or update issues, pull requests, discussions, or post comments, they append a `> Generated by [Workflow Name](run_url) for issue #N` attribution line. Use `footer: false` to hide this visible text while preserving the hidden XML markers used for search and tracking.

**Hide footers globally** (all safe output types):

```yaml wrap
safe-outputs:
  footer: false
  add-comment:
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[ai] "
```

**Hide footers for specific output types only:**

```yaml wrap
safe-outputs:
  footer: false            # hide for all by default
  create-pull-request:
    footer: true           # override: show footer for PRs only
```

Even with `footer: false`, the hidden `<!-- gh-aw-workflow-id: ... -->` XML marker is still included in the content for searchability - you can search GitHub for `"gh-aw-workflow-id: my-workflow" in:body` to find all items created by a workflow.

See [Footer Control](/gh-aw/reference/footers/) for complete documentation including per-handler overrides and PR review footer options.

### My workflow fails with "Runtime import file not found" when used in a repository ruleset

When a workflow is configured as a **required status check** in a [repository ruleset](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets), it runs in a restricted context that does not have access to other files in the repository. Shared files imported with the `imports:` field are loaded at runtime from the repository checkout, but this checkout is not available in the ruleset context.

This produces an error such as:

```
ERR_SYSTEM: Runtime import file not found: workflows/shared/file.md
```

The fix is to enable `inlined-imports: true` in your workflow frontmatter. This causes the compiler to bundle all imported content directly into the compiled `.lock.yml` at compile time, so no file system access is needed at runtime:

```aw wrap
---
on: pull_request
engine: copilot
inlined-imports: true
imports:
  - shared/common-tools.md
  - shared/security-setup.md
---

# My Workflow

Workflow instructions here.
```

After adding `inlined-imports: true`, recompile the workflow:

```bash
gh aw compile my-workflow
```

> [!NOTE]
> With `inlined-imports: true`, any change to an imported file requires recompiling the workflow to take effect. The compiled `.lock.yml` must be committed and pushed for the updated content to run.

> [!NOTE]
> `inlined-imports: true` cannot be combined with agent file imports (`.github/agents/` files). If your workflow imports a custom agent file, remove it before enabling inlined imports.

See [Imports](/gh-aw/reference/imports/) for full documentation on the `imports:` field.

## Workflow Design

### Should I focus on one workflow, or write many different ones?

One workflow is simpler to maintain and good for learning, while multiple workflows provide better separation of concerns, different triggers and permissions per task, and clearer audit trails. Start with one or two workflows, then expand as you understand the patterns. See [Peli's Agent Factory](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/) for examples.

### Should I create agentic workflows by hand editing or using AI?

Either approach works well. AI-assisted authoring using `/agent agentic-workflows create` in GitHub Copilot Chat provides interactive guidance with automatic best practices, while manual editing gives full control and is essential for advanced customizations. See [Creating Workflows](/gh-aw/setup/creating-workflows/) for AI-assisted approach, or [Reference documentation](/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/) for manual configuration.

### You use 'agent' and 'agentic workflow' interchangeably. Are they the same thing?

Yes, for the purpose of this technology. An **"agent"** is an agentic workflow in a repository - an AI-powered automation that can reason, make decisions, and take actions. We use **"agentic workflow"** as it's plainer and emphasizes the workflow nature of the automation, but the terms are synonymous in this context.

## Costs & Usage

### Who pays for the use of AI?

This depends on the AI engine (coding agent) you use:

- **GitHub Copilot CLI** (default): Usage is currently associated with the individual GitHub account of the user supplying the [`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`](/gh-aw/reference/auth/#copilot_github_token), and is drawn from the monthly quota of premium requests for that account. See [GitHub Copilot billing](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot).
- **Claude**: Usage is billed to the Anthropic account associated with [`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`](/gh-aw/reference/auth/#anthropic_api_key) Actions secret in the repository.
- **Codex**: Usage is billed to your OpenAI account associated with [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](/gh-aw/reference/auth/#openai_api_key) Actions secret in the repository.

### What's the approximate cost per workflow run?

Costs vary depending on workflow complexity, AI model, and execution time. GitHub Copilot CLI uses 1-2 premium requests per workflow execution with agentic processing. Track usage with `gh aw logs` for runs and metrics, `gh aw audit <run-id>` for detailed token usage and costs, or check your AI provider's usage portal. Consider creating separate PAT/API keys per repository for tracking.

Reduce costs by optimizing prompts, using smaller models, limiting tool calls, reducing run frequency, and caching results.

### Can I change the model being used, e.g., use a cheaper or more advanced one?

Yes! You can configure the model in your workflow frontmatter:

```yaml wrap
engine:
  id: copilot
  model: gpt-5                    # or claude-sonnet-4
```

Or switch to a different engine entirely:

```yaml wrap
engine: claude
```

See [AI Engines](/gh-aw/reference/engines/) for all configuration options.
