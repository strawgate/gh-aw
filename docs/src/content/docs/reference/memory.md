Agentic workflows maintain persistent memory through **cache-memory** (GitHub Actions cache, 7-day retention) or **repo-memory** (Git branches, unlimited retention).

## Cache Memory

Provides persistent file storage across workflow runs via GitHub Actions cache. The compiler automatically configures the cache directory, restore/save operations, and progressive fallback keys at `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/` (default) or `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory-{id}/` (additional caches).

### Enabling Cache Memory

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  cache-memory: true
---
```

Stores files at `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/` using default key `memory-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.run_id }}`. Use standard file operations to store/retrieve JSON/YAML, text files, or subdirectories.

### Advanced Configuration

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  cache-memory:
    key: custom-memory-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.run_id }}
    retention-days: 30  # 1-90 days, extends access beyond cache expiration
    allowed-extensions: [".json", ".txt", ".md"]  # Restrict file types (default: empty/all files allowed)
---
```

#### File Type Restrictions

The `allowed-extensions` field restricts which file types can be written to cache-memory. By default, all file types are allowed (empty array). When specified, only files with listed extensions can be stored.

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  cache-memory:
    allowed-extensions: [".json", ".jsonl", ".txt"]  # Only these extensions allowed
---
```

If files with disallowed extensions are found, the workflow will report validation failures.

### Multiple Configurations

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  cache-memory:
    - id: default
      key: memory-default
    - id: session
      key: memory-session-${{ github.run_id }}
    - id: logs
      retention-days: 7
---
```

Mounts at `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/` (default) or `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory-{id}/`. The `id` determines folder name; `key` defaults to `memory-{id}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.run_id }}`.

### Merging from Shared Workflows

```aw wrap
---
imports:
  - shared/mcp/server-memory.md
tools:
  cache-memory: true
---
```

Merge rules: **Single→Single** (local overrides), **Single→Multiple** (local converts to array), **Multiple→Multiple** (merge by `id`, local wins).

### Behavior

GitHub Actions cache: 7-day retention, 10GB per repo, LRU eviction. Add `retention-days` to upload artifacts (1-90 days) for extended access.

Caches accessible across branches with unique per-run keys. Custom keys auto-append `-${{ github.run_id }}`. Progressive restore splits on dashes: `custom-memory-project-v1-${{ github.run_id }}` tries `custom-memory-project-v1-`, `custom-memory-project-`, `custom-memory-`, `custom-`.

### Best Practices

Use descriptive file/directory names, hierarchical cache keys (`project-${{ github.repository_owner }}-${{ github.workflow }}`), and appropriate scope (workflow-specific default or repository/user-wide). Monitor growth within 10GB limit.

## Repo Memory

Persistent file storage via Git branches with unlimited retention. The compiler auto-configures branch cloning/creation, file access at `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory-{id}/`, commits/pushes, and merge conflict resolution (your changes win).

### Enabling Repo Memory

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  repo-memory: true
---
```

Creates branch `memory/default` at `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory-default/`. Files are stored within the branch at the branch name path (`memory/default/`). Files auto-commit/push after workflow completion.

### Advanced Configuration

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  repo-memory:
    branch-name: memory/custom-agent-for-aw
    branch-prefix: tracking  # Custom prefix instead of "memory"
    description: "Long-term insights"
    file-glob: ["memory/custom-agent-for-aw/*.md", "memory/custom-agent-for-aw/*.json"]
    max-file-size: 1048576  # 1MB (default 10KB)
    max-file-count: 50      # default 100
    target-repo: "owner/repository"
    create-orphan: true     # default
    allowed-extensions: [".json", ".txt", ".md"]  # Restrict file types (default: empty/all files allowed)
---
```

**Branch Prefix**: Use `branch-prefix` to customize the branch name prefix (default is `memory`). The prefix must be 4-32 characters, alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores, and cannot be `copilot`. When set, branches are created as `{branch-prefix}/{id}` instead of `memory/{id}`.

**File Type Restrictions**: Use `allowed-extensions` to restrict which file types can be stored (default: empty/all files allowed). When specified, only files with listed extensions (e.g., `[".json", ".txt", ".md"]`) can be saved. Files with disallowed extensions will trigger validation failures.

**Note**: File glob patterns must include the full branch path structure. For branch `memory/custom-agent-for-aw`, use patterns like `memory/custom-agent-for-aw/*.json` to match files stored at that path within the branch.

### Multiple Configurations

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  repo-memory:
    - id: insights
      branch-prefix: daily  # Creates daily/insights branch
      file-glob: ["daily/insights/*.md"]
    - id: state
      file-glob: ["memory/state/*.json"]
      max-file-size: 524288  # 512KB
---
```

Mounts at `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory-{id}/` during workflow execution. Required `id` determines folder name; `branch-name` defaults to `{branch-prefix}/{id}` (where `branch-prefix` defaults to `memory`). Files are stored within the git branch at the branch name path (e.g., for branch `memory/code-metrics`, files are stored at `memory/code-metrics/` within the branch). **File glob patterns must include the full branch path.**

### Behavior

Branches auto-create as orphans (default) or clone with `--depth 1`. Changes auto-commit after validation (`file-glob`, `max-file-size`, `max-file-count`), pull with `-X ours` (your changes win), and push when changes detected and threat detection passes. Auto-adds `contents: write` permission.

## Comparison

| Feature | Cache Memory | Repo Memory |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Storage | GitHub Actions Cache | Git Branches |
| Retention | 7 days | Unlimited |
| Size Limit | 10GB/repo | Repository limits |
| Version Control | No | Yes |
| Performance | Fast | Slower |
| Best For | Temporary/sessions | Long-term/history |

## Troubleshooting

### Cache Memory Problems

- **Files not persisting**: Check cache key consistency and logs for restore/save messages.
- **File access issues**: Create subdirectories first, verify permissions, use absolute paths.
- **Cache size issues**: Track growth, clear periodically, or use time-based keys for auto-expiration.

### Repo Memory Problems

- **Branch not created**: Ensure `create-orphan: true` or create manually.
- **Permission denied**: Compiler auto-adds `contents: write`.
- **Validation failures**: Match `file-glob`, stay under `max-file-size` (10KB default) and `max-file-count` (100 default).
- **Changes not persisting**: Check directory path, workflow completion, push errors in logs.
- **Merge conflicts**: Uses `-X ours` (your changes win). Read before writing to preserve data.

## Security

Don't store sensitive data in either memory type. Both follow repository permissions.

**Cache Memory**: Logs access. With [threat detection](/gh-aw/reference/threat-detection/), cache saves only after validation succeeds (restore→modify→upload artifact→validate→save).

**Repo Memory**: Use private repos for sensitive data, avoid storing secrets, set constraints (`file-glob`, `max-file-size`, `max-file-count`), consider branch protection, use `target-repo` to isolate.

## Examples
