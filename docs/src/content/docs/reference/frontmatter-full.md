## Schema Description

JSON Schema for validating agentic workflow frontmatter configuration

# GitHub Actions YAML file (.lock.yml)
# (optional)
description: "Description of the workflow"

# Optional source reference indicating where this workflow was added from. Format:

# Rendered as a comment in the generated lock file.
# (optional)
source: "example-value"

# Optional tracker identifier to tag all created assets (issues, discussions,
# comments, pull requests). Must be at least 8 characters and contain only

# inserted in the body/description of all created assets to enable searching and
# retrieving assets associated with this workflow.

# used to filter workflows in status/list commands.
# (optional)

# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/choosing-the-runner-for-a-job
# (optional)
# This field supports multiple formats (oneOf):

# Option 1: Simple runner label string. Use for standard GitHub-hosted runners

# Concurrency control to limit concurrent workflow runs (GitHub Actions standard
# field). Supports two forms: simple string for basic group isolation, or object

# this with automatic per-engine concurrency policies (defaults to single job per
# engine across all workflows) and token-based rate limiting. Default behavior:
# workflows in the same group queue sequentially unless cancel-in-progress is
# true. See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency
# (optional)
# This field supports multiple formats (oneOf):

# Option 1: Simple concurrency group name to prevent multiple runs in the same
# group. Use expressions like '${{ github.workflow }}' for per-workflow isolation
# or '${{ github.ref }}' for per-branch isolation. Agentic workflows automatically
# generate enhanced concurrency policies using 'gh-aw-{engine-id}' as the default
# group to limit concurrent AI workloads across all workflows using the same
# engine.
concurrency: "example-value"

# Option 2: Concurrency configuration object with group isolation and cancellation
# control. Use object form when you need fine-grained control over whether to
# cancel in-progress runs. For agentic workflows, this is useful to prevent
# multiple AI agents from running simultaneously and consuming excessive resources
# or API quotas.
concurrency:
  # Concurrency group name. Workflows in the same group cannot run simultaneously.
  # Supports GitHub Actions expressions for dynamic group names based on branch,
  # workflow, or other context.
  group: "example-value"

  # Whether to cancel in-progress workflows in the same concurrency group when a new
  # one starts. Default: false (queue new runs). Set to true for agentic workflows
  # where only the latest run matters (e.g., PR analysis that becomes stale when new
  # commits are pushed).
  # (optional)
  cancel-in-progress: true

# Environment variables for the workflow
# (optional)
# This field supports multiple formats (oneOf):

# Option 1: object
env:

# Option 2: string
env: "example-value"

# Feature flags and configuration options for experimental or optional features in

# 'action-tag' feature (string) specifies the tag or SHA to use when referencing
# actions/setup in compiled workflows (for testing purposes only).
# (optional)
features:
  {}

# Secret values passed to workflow execution. Secrets can be defined as simple
# strings (GitHub Actions expressions) or objects with 'value' and 'description'
# properties. Typically used to provide secrets to MCP servers or custom engines.
# Note: For passing secrets to reusable workflows, use the jobs.<job_id>.secrets

# (5) Deprecated Fields - refuses deprecated frontmatter fields. Can be enabled
# per-workflow via 'strict: true' in frontmatter, or disabled via 'strict: false'.
# CLI flag takes precedence over frontmatter (gh aw compile --strict enforces
# strict mode). Defaults to true. See:
# https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/#strict-mode-strict
# (optional)
strict: true

# Safe inputs configuration for defining custom lightweight MCP tools as
# JavaScript, shell scripts, or Python scripts. Tools are mounted in an MCP server
# and have access to secrets specified by the user. Only one of 'script'
# (JavaScript), 'run' (shell), or 'py' (Python) must be specified per tool.
# (optional)
safe-inputs:
  {}

# Runtime environment version overrides. Allows customizing runtime versions
# (e.g., Node.js, Python) or defining new runtimes. Runtimes from imported shared
# workflows are also merged.
# (optional)
runtimes:
  {}

# GitHub token expression to use for all steps that require GitHub authentication.
# Typically a secret reference like ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} or ${{
# secrets.CUSTOM_PAT }}. If not specified, defaults to ${{
# secrets.GH_AW_GITHUB_TOKEN || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}. This value can be
# overridden by safe-outputs github-token or individual safe-output github-token
# fields.
# (optional)
github-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
