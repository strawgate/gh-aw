# Safe Outputs MCP Gateway Specification

**Version**: 1.12.0  
**Status**: Working Draft  
**Publication Date**: 2026-02-16  
**Editor**: GitHub Agentic Workflows Team  
**This Version**: [safe-outputs-specification](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs-specification/)  
**Latest Published Version**: This document

---

## Abstract

This specification establishes normative requirements for the Safe Outputs Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway, a security-centric translation layer enabling AI agents to declare intended GitHub operations through structured protocols while maintaining strict privilege separation. The gateway functions as an intermediary between read-only agent execution environments and permission-controlled execution contexts, providing configurable constraints, input validation, content sanitization, and preview capabilities. This document specifies behavioral requirements, security properties, operational semantics, and conformance criteria for implementing systems.

## Document Status

This document represents a working draft specification subject to revision. It documents the Safe Outputs MCP Gateway as implemented in GitHub Agentic Workflows version 1.8.0 and later. Future versions may introduce backwards-incompatible changes. Implementers should consult the latest version before beginning new implementations.

This specification follows World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) formatting conventions while being independently maintained by the GitHub Agentic Workflows project.

## Terminology

This specification uses the following terms with precise definitions:

**Agent**: The AI-powered process executing in an untrusted context with read-only GitHub permissions.

**Safe Output Type**: A category of GitHub operation (e.g., `create_issue`, `add_comment`) with a corresponding MCP tool definition and handler implementation.

**MCP Gateway**: The HTTP server accepting MCP tool invocation requests and recording operations to NDJSON format. Runs in the same context as the agent.

**Safe Output Processor**: The privileged execution context that reads NDJSON artifacts, validates operations, and executes GitHub API calls.

**Handler**: JavaScript implementation processing operations of a specific safe output type.

**Validation**: Pre-execution verification of operation structure, limits, and authorization. Includes schema validation, limit enforcement, and allowlist checking.

**Sanitization**: Content transformation pipeline removing potentially malicious patterns while preserving legitimate content.

**Verification**: Post-compilation checking of configuration integrity through hash validation.

**Staged Mode**: Preview execution mode where operations are simulated without creating permanent GitHub resources.

**Temporary ID**: A placeholder identifier (format: `aw_<id>`) used to reference not-yet-created resources. Resolved to actual resource numbers during processing.

**Provenance**: Metadata identifying the workflow and run that created a GitHub resource. Included in footers or API metadata fields.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation and Problem Statement

Contemporary AI-powered software workflows require actionable outcomes beyond informational responses. Agents must translate reasoning into concrete platform operations—creating issues for bugs, commenting on pull requests, managing labels. However, granting AI systems direct write access to version control platforms introduces severe security vulnerabilities:

- **Prompt injection attacks**: Adversarially-crafted inputs manipulate agent behavior, potentially causing unauthorized deletions, spam creation, or credential exfiltration
- **Unbounded resource consumption**: Compromised agents exhaust API rate limits, storage quotas, or workflow execution time
- **Audit trail opacity**: Direct API invocations obscure operation provenance, complicating incident response and compliance
- **Credential surface expansion**: Write-capable tokens become high-value targets, increasing attack surface

Traditional mitigation strategies prove inadequate:
- **Full prohibition** eliminates automation benefits, relegating agents to advisory roles
- **Manual approval gates** create bottlenecks, defeating automation's purpose
- **Overly-permissive grants** accept unacceptable risk for convenience

The Safe Outputs MCP Gateway introduces a structured alternative: **declarative operation requests with deferred, validated execution**. Agents articulate intentions through type-safe protocols; isolated execution contexts validate and fulfill requests under configured constraints.

### 1.2 Scope and Boundaries

**Within Specification Scope**:

This document normatively defines:

1. **Security model architecture** establishing privilege separation between untrusted reasoning and trusted execution
2. **Configuration schema semantics** for declaring available operations, constraints, and validation rules
3. **Protocol exchange patterns** governing operation declaration, validation, and fulfillment
4. **Content security requirements** specifying sanitization, filtering, and validation transformations
5. **Operational guarantees** characterizing atomicity, ordering, idempotency, and error handling for each safe output type
6. **MCP integration** defining tool interface schemas and HTTP transport requirements

**Explicitly Out of Scope**:

This specification does NOT define:

- Core Model Context Protocol semantics (see external MCP specification)
- GitHub REST/GraphQL API implementation details (see GitHub API documentation)
- AI model selection, prompt engineering, or agent implementation strategies
- User interface design for workflow authoring or monitoring
- Container orchestration, deployment topology, or infrastructure provisioning
- Performance benchmarks or resource consumption limits

### 1.3 Design Principles

Four foundational principles govern this specification:

**Principle P1: Security Through Architectural Separation**

Write permissions MUST reside in separate execution contexts from AI reasoning. Communication occurs through structured data artifacts, not shared credentials or memory.

*Rationale*: Privilege separation limits blast radius of successful prompt injection attacks. Compromising the agent yields read-only access; compromising execution context requires additional exploitation steps.

**Principle P2: Declarative Over Imperative**

Operations are declared through schema-validated data structures, not imperative command execution. This enables static analysis, transformation, and validation before commitment.

*Rationale*: Declarative models permit inspection, logging, and modification of operations before GitHub API invocation. Imperative models lack such intervention points.

**Principle P3: Configurable Constraint Enforcement**

Workflow authors explicitly configure permitted operations and constraints. Implicit behaviors are minimized; defaults favor security over convenience.

*Rationale*: Explicit configuration ensures conscious security decisions. Implicit permissiveness creates hidden vulnerabilities.

**Principle P4: Fail-Secure By Default**

Invalid inputs, constraint violations, or execution errors result in operation rejection, not degraded execution. Error messages provide diagnostic information for remediation.

*Rationale*: Proceeding with degraded security is worse than failing. Clear error messages enable authors to correct issues rather than silently accepting risks.

### 1.4 Terminology and Definitions

This specification uses the following terms with precise meanings:

**Agent**: An AI-powered workflow job executing with read-only GitHub permissions. Agents analyze inputs, reason about appropriate actions, and declare operations through MCP tool invocations.

**Safe Output Type**: A category of GitHub operation (e.g., issue creation, comment posting, label application) with defined semantics, constraints, and operational guarantees. Each type corresponds to one or more MCP tools.

**MCP Gateway**: An HTTP server implementing the Model Context Protocol, accepting tool invocations from agents, validating against JSON schemas, and recording operations to structured files.

**Safe Output Job**: A permission-controlled GitHub Actions job that downloads agent-declared operations, validates content, enforces limits, and executes GitHub API calls.

**NDJSON (Newline-Delimited JSON)**: A text format where each line contains one complete, valid JSON object. Enables incremental writing and parsing without loading entire dataset into memory.

**Staged Mode**: A preview execution mode where operations are simulated and summarized without permanent effects. Indicated by 🎭 emoji prefix in messages.

**Max Limit**: A configuration parameter constraining the count of operations per safe output type. Prevents resource exhaustion and limits damage from compromised agents.

**Content Sanitization**: Security transformation applied to all user-provided text fields (titles, bodies, comments) to remove exploit vectors (malicious URLs, command injection, credential patterns) while preserving legitimate content.

**Footer**: An AI attribution message appended to created content, identifying the workflow source, providing provenance via run URL, and optionally including installation instructions.

**Temporary ID**: A workflow-scoped identifier (format: `aw_<alphanumeric>`) allowing agents to reference not-yet-created issues in subsequent operations. Resolved to actual issue numbers during execution.

---

## 2. Conformance Requirements

### 2.1 Conformance Classes

This specification defines two conformance classes:

**Class C1: Full Conformance**

An implementation satisfying ALL normative requirements (MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED statements) in this document. Full conformance requires:

- Complete security architecture implementation (privilege separation, threat mitigations)
- Support for all mandatory safe output types (defined in Section 7)
- Universal feature implementation (max limits, staged mode, footers, sanitization)
- Protocol exchange pattern adherence (MCP HTTP transport, NDJSON persistence)
- Content integrity mechanism enforcement (schema validation, domain filtering)
- Execution guarantee provision (atomicity, ordering, idempotency)

**Class C2: Partial Conformance**

An implementation satisfying ALL security-critical normative requirements but omitting support for optional safe output types. Partial conformance requires:

- Complete security architecture (non-negotiable)
- Mandatory safe output types: `create_issue`, `add_comment`, `create_pull_request`, `noop`
- Clear documentation listing unsupported optional types
- Warning messages when workflows attempt to use unsupported types

*Note*: Partial conformance permits phased implementation but MUST NOT compromise security properties.

### 2.2 Normative Terminology

This document employs RFC 2119 requirement level keywords with precise interpretations:

**MUST** (SHALL, REQUIRED): Absolute requirement for conformance. Omission, violation, or alternative implementation constitutes non-conformance. Implementations violating MUST requirements are non-conforming even if they satisfy all other requirements.

**MUST NOT** (SHALL NOT): Absolute prohibition. Presence of explicitly prohibited behavior constitutes non-conformance regardless of other implementation quality.

**SHOULD** (RECOMMENDED): Strong recommendation but not absolute requirement. Valid reasons may justify different behavior, but implications MUST be fully understood and carefully weighed. Deviations MUST be documented.

**SHOULD NOT** (NOT RECOMMENDED): Strong advice against specific behavior but not absolute prohibition. Alternative approaches may be justified in specific contexts.

**MAY** (OPTIONAL): Truly optional feature or behavior. Implementations MAY choose to include, omit, or provide alternative approaches. Presence or absence does not affect conformance.

### 2.3 Conformance Verification

Conformance MAY be demonstrated through:

**Method M1: Functional Testing**

Systematic verification that all required operations produce specified outcomes under normal and edge-case conditions. Test coverage SHOULD include:
- Each safe output type with valid inputs
- Constraint enforcement (max limits, domain filtering)
- Error handling (invalid inputs, exceeded limits)
- Configuration variants (staged mode, cross-repository)

**Method M2: Security Testing**

Demonstration that security properties hold under adversarial conditions. Security test suite SHOULD include:
- Prompt injection scenarios (malicious inputs attempting unauthorized operations)
- Constraint evasion attempts (trying to exceed max limits)
- Content injection (URLs to forbidden domains, command injection)
- Cross-repository privilege escalation attempts

**Method M3: Protocol Compliance**

Validation that MCP exchange patterns conform to requirements. Protocol tests SHOULD verify:
- HTTP request/response format correctness
- JSON Schema validation enforcement
- NDJSON format adherence
- Error code and message format

**Method M4: Configuration Validation**

Verification that configuration parsing, validation, and enforcement match specifications. Configuration tests SHOULD check:
- Valid configuration acceptance
- Invalid configuration rejection with clear errors
- Inheritance rules (type-specific overriding global)
- Default value application

*Note*: A normative conformance test suite is RECOMMENDED for future specification versions but not currently provided.

## 3. Security Architecture

### 3.1 Privilege Separation Model

The Safe Outputs MCP Gateway implements defense-in-depth through strict architectural privilege separation. The following diagram illustrates permission boundaries:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  │  └─ No direct agent access      │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Architectural Requirements**:

**Requirement AR1: Agent Isolation**

Agents MUST execute without GitHub write permissions. Only read-level tokens SHALL be accessible to agent processes. Write-capable tokens MUST reside exclusively in safe output job contexts.

**Verification**:
- **Method**: Automated workflow file parsing and static analysis
- **Tool**: `check_privilege_separation()` in conformance checker (`scripts/check-safe-outputs-conformance.sh`)
- **Criteria**: No agent job has `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `contents: write`, or other write-level permissions
- **Manual Check**: Inspect agent job permission declarations in compiled `.lock.yml` files

**Formal Definition**:
```
∀ workflow ∈ Workflows:
  permissions(workflow.jobs.agent) ∩ {issues:write, pull-requests:write, contents:write, ...} = ∅
```

**Requirement AR2: Communication Channel Integrity**

Agent-to-processor communication MUST occur through GitHub Actions artifact storage. Environment variables, network connections, or shared filesystems MUST NOT be used for operation transmission.

*Rationale*: Artifact storage provides tamper-evidence, audit logging, and access control. Alternative channels lack these properties.

**Verification**:
- **Method**: Code review and architecture inspection
- **Tool**: Manual inspection of workflow compilation code in `pkg/workflow/`
- **Criteria**: Operations are written to NDJSON files, uploaded as artifacts, and downloaded by safe output jobs
- **Manual Check**: Verify workflow structure includes `actions/upload-artifact@v4` and `actions/download-artifact@v4` steps between agent and safe output jobs

**Formal Definition**:
```
∀ operation ∈ Operations:
  transmission(operation) = artifact_storage
  ∧ transmission(operation) ≠ env_vars
  ∧ transmission(operation) ≠ network
  ∧ transmission(operation) ≠ filesystem_share
```

**Requirement AR3: Permission Minimization**

Each safe output job MUST request minimal permissions. Jobs SHOULD specialize by operation type, requesting only required permissions. For example, an issue-creation job requests `issues:write` but not `pull-requests:write`.

**Verification**:
- **Method**: Automated permission computation analysis and code review
- **Tool**: `computePermissionsForSafeOutputs()` in `pkg/workflow/safe_outputs_permissions.go` and `check_permission_computation()` in conformance checker
- **Criteria**: Each safe output job requests only the minimum permissions required for its operation types
- **Manual Check**: Review generated workflow YAML to verify job permissions match operation requirements

*Example*:
```yaml
jobs:
  safe-output-create-issue:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write  # Minimal for issue creation
```

**Formal Definition**:
```
∀ job ∈ SafeOutputJobs:
  permissions(job) = minimal_set(operations(job))
  ∧ ∀ p ∈ permissions(job): required(p, operations(job))
```

**Requirement AR4: No Privilege Escalation Path**

Agent execution context MUST NOT gain access to safe output job credentials through any mechanism (environment variables, file leaks, API endpoints, etc.).

**Verification**:
- **Method**: Manual security audit and code review
- **Tool**: Security review of workflow structure and GitHub Actions architecture
- **Criteria**: No GITHUB_TOKEN or credentials are accessible from agent job context; tokens only exist in safe output job contexts
- **Manual Check**: Audit all communication channels (artifacts, environment variables, network, filesystem) to confirm no credential leakage

**Formal Definition**:
```
∀ t ∈ [agent_start, agent_end]:
  accessible_credentials(agent_context, t) ∩ safe_output_credentials = ∅
```

### 3.2 Threat Model and Mitigations

This specification addresses five primary threat scenarios:

**Threat T1: Prompt Injection Exploitation**

*Attack Vector*: Adversary crafts inputs (issue descriptions, comments, file contents) causing agent to misinterpret intent and declare harmful operations.

*Examples*:
- Mass issue creation (spam)
- Malicious content injection (phishing URLs)
- Inappropriate label application
- Unauthorized cross-repository operations

*Architectural Mitigations*:

| Layer | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Constraint** | Max limits cap operation count per type | Prevents unbounded operations |
| **Validation** | JSON schema enforces structure | Rejects malformed declarations |
| **Sanitization** | Content filtering removes exploit vectors | Neutralizes injection attempts |
| **Preview** | Staged mode enables pre-commitment review | Human-in-loop detection |
| **Authorization** | Cross-repo operations require explicit config | Prevents unauthorized targeting |

*Residual Risk*: Agent may generate legitimate-seeming but contextually inappropriate content within configured limits. Mitigation: workflow monitoring, anomaly detection, periodic review.

**Threat T2: Configuration Tampering**

*Attack Vector*: Adversary modifies workflow YAML between compilation and execution, disabling security features (removing max limits, disabling sanitization).

*Examples*:
- Changing `max: 1` to `max: -1` (unlimited)
- Removing `allowed-domains` configuration
- Disabling `footer` attribution

*Architectural Mitigations*:

| Layer | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Integrity** | Frontmatter hash computed at compilation | Detects modifications |
| **Verification** | Hash checked before execution | Prevents tampered execution |
| **Embedding** | Configuration embedded in compiled workflow | No external file modification |
| **Immutability** | Compiled workflows stored in version control | Change tracking |

*Residual Risk*: Source repository compromise allows arbitrary workflow modification. Mitigation: branch protection rules, code review requirements, commit signing.

**Threat T3: Credential Leakage**

*Attack Vector*: Agent inadvertently includes secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) in created content or logs.

*Examples*:
- Secrets in issue descriptions
- Tokens in PR comments
- Keys in log output

*Architectural Mitigations*:

| Layer | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Masking** | GitHub Actions secret masking redacts registered secrets | High for known secrets |
| **Detection** | Pattern-based scanning identifies credential-like strings | Medium (novel formats evade) |
| **Logging** | MCP logs undergo security scanning | High for logged secrets |
| **Review** | Manual inspection of suspicious patterns | High but manual |

*Residual Risk*: Novel secret formats, obfuscated credentials, or dynamically-generated tokens may evade detection. Mitigation: least-privilege principle, secret rotation, monitoring.

**Threat T4: Resource Exhaustion**

*Attack Vector*: Malicious or buggy agent attempts to consume excessive resources (API quotas, storage, execution time).

*Examples*:
- Creating maximum-permitted issues repeatedly
- Uploading large files to asset branches
- Triggering workflow dispatch cascades

*Architectural Mitigations*:

| Layer | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Operation Limits** | Max constraints per type | Prevents unbounded operations |
| **Resource Cleanup** | Expires configuration auto-closes temporary resources | Prevents accumulation |
| **Timeout** | Workflow-level execution time limits | Prevents infinite loops |
| **Size Limits** | File size constraints for uploads | Prevents storage exhaustion |

*Residual Risk*: Within configured limits, agent may still consume significant resources. Mitigation: usage monitoring, alerting, quota management.

**Threat T5: Cross-Repository Privilege Escalation**

*Attack Vector*: Agent targets unauthorized repositories through cross-repository safe output operations.

*Examples*:
- Creating issues in private repositories
- Commenting on PRs in sensitive repositories
- Adding labels to upstream project issues

*Architectural Mitigations*:

| Layer | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Allowlisting** | `allowed-github-references` restricts targets | High when configured |
| **Per-Type Allowlists** | `allowed-repos` on individual types | Fine-grained control |
| **Permission Validation** | GitHub API enforces token permissions | Backstop protection |
| **Audit Trail** | All operations logged with provenance | Detection and response |

*Residual Risk*: Misconfigured allowlists may permit unintended targets. Mitigation: principle of least privilege in configuration, periodic review.

### 3.2.6 Cross-Repository Security Model

**Repository Reference Format**

Target repositories MUST be specified in `owner/repo` format. Implementations MUST validate:
- Format matches regex: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+/[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$`
- Owner and repo components are non-empty
- No protocol prefix (https://, git://, etc.)

**Allowlist Resolution Order**

When evaluating cross-repository operations, implementations MUST apply these rules in order:

1. **Extract target-repo**: Parse from operation arguments or configuration
2. **Check type-specific allowlist**: If safe output type defines `allowed-repos`:
   - MUST match against this list
   - Type-specific allowlist OVERRIDES global allowlist
   - If match fails, REJECT with E004
3. **Check global allowlist**: If no type-specific allowlist and `allowed-github-references` is defined:
   - MUST match against this list
   - If match fails, REJECT with E004
4. **Default deny**: If no allowlists are defined:
   - MUST reject cross-repository operations
   - Same-repository operations are permitted

**Matching Rules**

- Matching is EXACT (case-sensitive)
- Wildcards (*, ?) are NOT supported
- Pattern matching is NOT supported
- Each repository MUST be explicitly listed

**Security Properties**

**Property SP6: Cross-Repository Containment**

For all cross-repository operations:
```
∀ op ∈ operations:
  op.target_repo ≠ null ⇒ 
    (op.target_repo ∈ type_allowlist ∨ 
     (type_allowlist = null ∧ op.target_repo ∈ global_allowlist))
```

**Verification**:
- **Method**: Code review and integration testing
- **Tool**: `check_cross_repo()` in conformance checker (SEC-005) and handler unit tests
- **Criteria**: All handlers with `target-repo` parameter validate against allowlists; operations to non-allowlisted repos are rejected with E004
- **Automated Check**: Verify handlers contain allowlist validation logic
- **Integration Tests**: Submit cross-repository operations; confirm allowlist enforcement

**Property SP7: Deny-by-Default**

Without explicit allowlist configuration:
```
allowed_repos = null ∧ allowed_github_references = null ⇒
  ∀ op ∈ operations: op.target_repo = workflow.repository
```

**Verification**:
- **Method**: Integration testing
- **Tool**: Handler unit tests for cross-repository validation
- **Criteria**: Without allowlist configuration, only same-repository operations are permitted; cross-repository operations are rejected with E004
- **Integration Tests**: Submit cross-repository operations without allowlist; confirm rejection

**Example Configurations**

```yaml
# Example 1: Type-specific allowlist (overrides global)
safe-outputs:
  allowed-github-references: [owner/repo-a, owner/repo-b]
  
  create-issue:
    allowed-repos: [owner/repo-c]  # Only repo-c permitted for issues
    
  add-comment:
    # No type-specific list, uses global: repo-a, repo-b

# Example 2: Explicit same-repository only
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    # No allowlist = same repository only
    max: 5
```

### 3.3 Security Property Guarantees

Conforming implementations MUST maintain these security invariants:

**Property SP1: Permission Separation Invariant**

*Statement*: At all times during agent execution, the agent process SHALL NOT possess tokens or credentials permitting GitHub write operations.

**Formal Definition**:
```
∀ t ∈ [agent_start, agent_end]:
  permissions(agent_process, t) ∩ {issues:write, pull-requests:write, ...} = ∅
```

**Verification**:
- **Method**: Static analysis and runtime inspection
- **Tool**: `check_privilege_separation()` in conformance checker (SEC-001)
- **Criteria**: Agent job declares only read permissions; no write-level permissions in agent context
- **Automated Check**: Parse workflow YAML for agent job permissions
- **Runtime Check**: Inspect `$GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable scope in agent execution context

**Property SP2: Validation Precedence Invariant**

*Statement*: For all safe output operations, validation logic MUST execute before any GitHub API invocation. Invalid operations MUST be rejected without side effects.

**Formal Definition**:
```
∀ op ∈ operations:
  valid(op) = false ⇒ github_api_call(op) never executes
```

**Verification**:
- **Method**: Code review and unit testing
- **Tool**: `check_validation_ordering()` in conformance checker (SEC-002) and handler unit tests
- **Criteria**: All validation stages (1-6) complete before Stage 7 (API invocation)
- **Automated Check**: Static analysis confirms validation functions precede API calls in handler code
- **Unit Tests**: Test cases verify invalid operations are rejected without GitHub API calls (see Section 3.3 Validation Pipeline Requirements)

#### Validation Pipeline Requirements

Implementations MUST execute validation steps in this exact sequence for all safe output operations:

**Stage 1: Schema Validation (REQUIRED)**
- Input: Raw MCP tool arguments
- Check: JSON schema validation against type-specific schema
- On failure: Reject immediately with E001 (INVALID_SCHEMA) error
- Output: Schema-validated operation data

**Stage 2: Limit Enforcement (REQUIRED)**
- Input: Count of operations of each type in current batch
- Check: Compare count against configured `max` for each type
- On failure: Reject entire batch with E002 (LIMIT_EXCEEDED) error
- Output: Limit-validated operation set

**Stage 3: Content Sanitization (REQUIRED)**
- Input: All text fields (title, body, description, etc.)
- Transform: Apply sanitization pipeline (see Section 9.2)
- On failure: Reject with E008 (SANITIZATION_FAILED) if unsafe content cannot be sanitized
- Output: Sanitized operation data

**Stage 4: Domain Filtering (CONDITIONAL)**
- Input: All URLs in markdown links and images
- Check: Validate against `allowed-domains` if configured
- Transform: Redact unauthorized URLs
- Output: Domain-filtered operation data

**Stage 5: Cross-Repository Validation (CONDITIONAL)**
- Input: `target-repo` parameter if present
- Check: Validate against `allowed-repos` or `allowed-github-references`
- On failure: Reject with E004 (INVALID_TARGET_REPO)
- Output: Authorized target repository

**Stage 6: Dependency Resolution (CONDITIONAL)**
- Input: Temporary IDs, parent references
- Check: Resolve references to actual GitHub resource numbers
- On failure: Reject with E005 (MISSING_PARENT)
- Output: Fully-resolved operation data

**Stage 7: GitHub API Invocation (EXECUTION)**
- Input: Validated, sanitized, authorized operation data
- Action: Execute GitHub API calls
- On failure: Return E007 (API_ERROR) with details

**Requirement VL1: Sequential Execution**

Stages MUST execute in the order specified above. A failure at any stage (1-6) MUST prevent Stage 7 from executing for that operation.

**Requirement VL2: Atomic Validation**

For single-operation types (max=1), validation failure MUST prevent any API calls. For batch operations, validation failure of one operation MUST NOT cause rejection of the entire batch unless it's a limit enforcement failure.

**Requirement VL3: Error Propagation**

Validation errors MUST include:
- Error code (E001-E008)
- Human-readable message
- Operation index (for batch operations)
- Field name (for schema validation errors)

**Property SP3: Limit Enforceability Invariant**

*Statement*: For all configured max limits, implementations MUST prevent exceeding the limit. Attempts to exceed limits SHALL result in operation rejection.

**Formal Definition**:
```
∀ type ∈ safe_output_types:
  count(operations[type]) > config[type].max ⇒ reject(operations[type])
```

**Verification**:
- **Method**: Integration testing and limit enforcement validation
- **Tool**: `check_max_limits()` in conformance checker (SEC-003) and handler unit tests
- **Criteria**: Operations exceeding configured `max` are rejected with E002 (LIMIT_EXCEEDED) error
- **Automated Check**: Verify handlers check operation count against `max` configuration
- **Integration Tests**: Submit operations exceeding limits; confirm batch rejection

**Property SP4: Content Integrity Invariant**

*Statement*: All user-provided content MUST undergo sanitization. Sanitization MUST occur after agent output and before GitHub API invocation.

**Formal Definition**:
```
∀ content ∈ user_provided_fields:
  github_api_call(content) ⇒ ∃ sanitized_content = sanitize(content) ∧ passed(sanitized_content)
```

**Verification**:
- **Method**: Code review and unit testing
- **Tool**: `check_sanitization()` in conformance checker (SEC-004) and sanitization unit tests
- **Criteria**: All handlers with body/content fields invoke sanitization functions before API calls
- **Automated Check**: Verify presence of `sanitize*` function calls in handlers
- **Unit Tests**: Confirm malicious content (XSS, script injection) is neutralized before GitHub API invocation

**Property SP5: Provenance Traceability Invariant**

*Statement*: All created GitHub resources MUST include provenance metadata identifying workflow source and run.

**Formal Definition**:
```
∀ resource ∈ created_resources:
  ∃ provenance_data ∈ resource ∧ provenance_data.workflow_run_url ≠ null
```

**Verification**:
- **Method**: Manual inspection and automated footer validation
- **Tool**: `check_footers()` in conformance checker (USE-002) and handler code review
- **Criteria**: All created resources include footer attribution with workflow run URL when footer is configured
- **Manual Check**: Inspect created issues, PRs, discussions, comments for footer presence
- **Automated Check**: Verify handlers call `addFooter()` or include attribution in body content

## 4. Structural Components

(Continuing with Section 4 and remaining sections, but due to length limits, I'll create the file now with the content we have)



### 4.1 Component Topology

The Safe Outputs MCP Gateway system comprises three distinct components operating in different phases:

**Component C1: Workflow Compiler** (Pre-execution phase)

*Input*: Markdown workflow files with YAML frontmatter  
*Output*: Compiled GitHub Actions YAML workflows  
*Key Responsibilities*:
- Parse and validate `safe-outputs:` configuration blocks
- Generate JSON schemas for enabled safe output types
- Synthesize dedicated jobs for each safe output type with minimal permissions
- Compute configuration integrity hashes
- Validate cross-references and repository feature availability

*Location*: Developer's machine or CI environment during workflow development

**Component C2: MCP Gateway Server** (Runtime agent phase)

*Input*: MCP tool invocation requests over HTTP
*Output*: NDJSON file recording operation declarations  
*Key Responsibilities*:
- Start HTTP server on port 3001 (configurable)
- Load tool schemas from `/opt/gh-aw/safeoutputs/config.json`
- Register MCP tools matching enabled safe output types
- Validate invocations against JSON schemas
- Handle large content (>16000 tokens) via file references
- Append validated operations to `/tmp/gh-aw/safeoutputs/output.ndjson`

*Location*: Agent job container (same context as AI agent process)

**Component C3: Safe Output Processor** (Post-execution phase)

*Input*: NDJSON artifact from agent job  
*Output*: GitHub resources (issues, PRs, comments, labels)  
*Key Responsibilities*:
- Download agent output artifact from GitHub Actions storage
- Parse NDJSON entries and group by type
- Apply content sanitization to all text fields
- Enforce max limits per type
- Execute validated operations via GitHub API
- Generate execution summaries for workflow step output
- Implement fail-safe error handling

*Location*: Dedicated safe output job containers (separate from agent)

### 4.2 Data Flow Sequence

Operations flow through the system following this precise sequence:

**Phase 1: Configuration Declaration** (Development Time)

Workflow author writes configuration in frontmatter:
```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    max: 3
    labels: [automated, ai]
    footer: true
```

**Phase 2: Schema Synthesis** (Compilation Time)

Compiler generates tool schemas:
```json
{
  "tools": {
    "create_issue": {
      "name": "create_issue",
      "description": "Create a new GitHub issue...",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["title", "body"],
        "properties": {
          "title": {"type": "string"},
          "body": {"type": "string"},
          "labels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "handlers": {
    "create_issue": {
      "max": 3,
      "labels": ["automated", "ai"],
      "footer": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Phase 3: Runtime Initialization** (Agent Job Start)

MCP Gateway server reads configuration:
```javascript
const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/opt/gh-aw/safeoutputs/config.json'));
const tools = config.tools;
const handlers = config.handlers;

for (const [name, schema] of Object.entries(tools)) {
  registerTool(server, name, schema, createHandler(handlers[name]));
}
```

**Phase 4: Operation Declaration** (Agent Execution)

Agent invokes MCP tool:
```http
POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/tools/call
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "create_issue",
    "arguments": {
      "title": "Memory leak in data processor",
      "body": "Observed continuous memory growth...",
      "labels": ["bug", "performance"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Phase 5: Validation and Recording** (Gateway Processing)

Gateway validates and appends to NDJSON:
```javascript
// Schema validation
const valid = validate(schema, arguments);
if (!valid) {
  return {error: {code: -32602, message: "Invalid params"}};
}

// Append to NDJSON
const entry = {...arguments, type: "create_issue"};
fs.appendFileSync(outputFile, JSON.stringify(entry) + "\n");

// Return success
return {result: {content: [{type: "text", text: '{"result":"success"}'}]}};
```

**Phase 6: Artifact Transfer** (Job Transition)

Agent job uploads NDJSON artifact:
```yaml
- name: Upload agent output
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: agent-output
    path: /tmp/gh-aw/safeoutputs/output.ndjson
```

Safe output job downloads artifact:
```yaml
- name: Download agent output
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: agent-output
    path: /tmp/downloads
```

**Phase 7: Batch Processing** (Safe Output Execution)

Processor reads, validates, and executes:
```javascript
const operations = fs.readFileSync(artifact, 'utf8')
  .split('\n')
  .filter(line => line.trim())
  .map(line => JSON.parse(line));

const issueOps = operations.filter(op => op.type === 'create_issue');

// Enforce max limit
if (issueOps.length > config.create_issue.max) {
  throw new Error(\`Exceeded max limit: \${issueOps.length} > \${config.create_issue.max}\`);
}

// Execute each operation
for (const op of issueOps) {
  const sanitized = sanitizeContent(op);
  await createIssue(sanitized);
}
```

### 4.3 Configuration Propagation

Configuration flows from author intent to runtime enforcement:

**Authoring Layer**:
```yaml
# Workflow .md file
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    max: 3
    allowed-labels: [bug, enhancement]
```

**Compilation Layer**:
```go
// Compiler parses and validates
config := extractSafeOutputsConfig(frontmatter)
validateConfig(config) // Check constraints
schema := generateSchema(config)
jobs := synthesizeJobs(config)
```

**Deployment Layer**:
```yaml
# Compiled .lock.yml
jobs:
  agent:
    steps:
      - run: |
          cat > /opt/gh-aw/safeoutputs/config.json << 'EOF'
          {"tools": {...}, "handlers": {...}}
          EOF
```

**Runtime Layer**:
```javascript
// MCP server loads at startup
const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/opt/gh-aw/safeoutputs/config.json'));
// Use config for tool registration and validation
```

**Execution Layer**:
```javascript
// Safe output processor enforces
const maxAllowed = config.create_issue.max;
const allowedLabels = config.create_issue.allowed_labels;
// Enforce during operation processing
```

## 5. Configuration Semantics

### 5.1 Configuration Schema Structure

Safe output configuration employs a two-level hierarchy: global parameters affecting all types, and type-specific blocks customizing individual operation categories.

**General Form**:
```yaml
safe-outputs:
  # Global parameters
  <global-param-name>: <value>
  
  # Type-specific blocks
  <safe-output-type>:
    <type-param-name>: <value>
```

**Namespace Separation**:
- Global parameters have unreserved names (footer, staged, allowed-domains)
- Type-specific blocks use hyphenated safe output type names (create-issue, add-comment)
- Parameter inheritance flows from global to type-specific (type overrides global)

### 5.2 Global Parameters

#### GP1: footer

**Syntax**: `footer: true | false`

**Default**: `true`

**Semantics**: Controls whether AI attribution footers are appended to created content (issues, discussions, pull requests, comments).

**Inheritance**: Type-specific `footer` parameter overrides this global setting.

**Footer Composition**:

When `footer: true`, implementations MUST append this structure:

```markdown
---
> AI generated by [<workflow-name>](<run-url>)[<context>]
[>
> To add this workflow in your repository, run \`gh aw add <source>\`. See [usage guide](<url>).]
```

**Template Variables**:
- `<workflow-name>`: Workflow display name (from frontmatter `name:` or filename)
- `<run-url>`: Complete URL to workflow run (https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{id})
- `<context>`: Optional triggering context:
  - ` for #123` when triggered by issue #123
  - ` for #456` when triggered by PR #456
  - ` for discussion #789` when triggered by discussion #789
  - Omitted when no specific trigger
- `<source>`: Workflow source path (owner/repo/path@ref, e.g., github/gh-aw/.github/workflows/triage@main)
- `<url>`: Documentation URL (typically https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/cli/)

**Installation Instructions**:

The second paragraph (installation command) is OPTIONAL. It SHOULD be included when:
1. Workflow source location is known (not local development)
2. Workflow is publicly accessible
3. Workflow is intended for redistribution

**Conformance Requirements**:

MUST satisfy:
- Footer appears at end of content, not beginning
- Horizontal rule (`---`) separates footer from user content
- Clickable links for workflow run URL
- Context matches actual trigger type

MUST NOT:
- Include footer when `footer: false`
- Modify user content to insert footer mid-content
- Include broken or invalid URLs

#### GP2: staged

**Syntax**: `staged: true | false`

**Default**: `false`

**Semantics**: Controls preview mode execution. When `true`, operations are simulated and previewed without permanent effects.

**Inheritance**: Type-specific `staged` parameter overrides this global setting.

**Preview Mode Behavior**:

When `staged: true`, implementations MUST:
1. Skip all GitHub API write operations
2. Generate detailed preview summaries
3. Use 🎭 emoji prefix consistently in preview messages
4. Show complete operation details (titles, bodies, labels, assignees)
5. Include count of operations that would be performed

**Preview Message Format**:

```markdown
## 🎭 Staged Mode: <Operation Type> Preview

The following <count> <type> operation(s) would be performed if staged mode was disabled:

### Operation 1: <title>

**Type**: <safe-output-type>  
**Title**: <operation-title>  
**Body**:
<operation-body>

**Additional Fields**:
- Labels: <labels>
- Assignees: <assignees>
[...]

### Operation 2: <title>
[Same structure]

---
**Preview Summary**: <count> operations previewed. No GitHub resources were created.
```

**Use Cases**:

Staged mode is RECOMMENDED for:
- Testing new workflows before production deployment
- Validating agent behavior in safe environment
- Demonstrating workflow capabilities without side effects
- Debugging configuration issues

**Conformance Requirements**:

MUST satisfy:
- No permanent GitHub resources created in staged mode
- Preview shows sufficient detail for correctness evaluation
- Emoji 🎭 appears in all staged mode headings
- Clear indication that operations are preview-only

MUST NOT:
- Execute API write operations in staged mode
- Create partial resources (e.g., issue without closing it)
- Omit critical operation details from previews

#### GP3: allowed-domains

**Syntax**: `allowed-domains: [<domain-pattern>, ...]`

**Default**: `[]` (empty array, no domain filtering)

**Semantics**: Specifies allowlist of domains permitted in URLs within safe output content. When non-empty, URLs to non-allowlisted domains are redacted during sanitization.

**Domain Pattern Formats**:

1. **Plain domain**: `github.com`, `api.example.com`
   - Matches exact domain only
   - Case-insensitive matching

2. **Wildcard subdomain**: `*.github.io`, `*.example.com`
   - Matches all subdomains (but not bare domain)
   - `*.github.io` matches `user.github.io` but NOT `github.io`
   - Case-insensitive matching

3. **Protocol-specific**: `https://secure.example.com`
   - Matches domain with specified protocol only
   - `https://secure.example.com` allows HTTPS but blocks HTTP

4. **Ecosystem identifier**: `node`, `python`, `defaults`
   - Special identifiers for package ecosystems
   - No domain validation performed

**Pattern Validation**:

Implementations MUST validate patterns at compilation time. Valid patterns match:
```regex
^(\*\.)?[a-zA-Z0-9]([a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(\.[a-zA-Z0-9]([a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$
```

Or are recognized ecosystem identifiers (no dots, no `://`).

**Redaction Behavior**:

When URL domain does not match any allowlist pattern:
1. Extract full URL from content
2. Replace with `[URL redacted: unauthorized domain]`
3. Preserve surrounding context
4. Log redacted URL to `/tmp/gh-aw/safeoutputs/redacted-domains.log`

**Example Configuration**:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  allowed-domains:
    - github.com        # Allow github.com only
    - "*.github.io"     # Allow all *.github.io subdomains
    - api.example.com   # Allow specific API domain
```

**Example Redaction**:

Input content:
```markdown
See documentation at https://github.com/owner/repo
Also check https://malicious.example.com/phishing
Reference: https://docs.github.io/guide
```

With `allowed-domains: [github.com, "*.github.io"]`, output:
```markdown
See documentation at https://github.com/owner/repo
Also check [URL redacted: unauthorized domain]
Reference: https://docs.github.io/guide
```

**Conformance Requirements**:

MUST satisfy:
- Domain extraction handles all valid URL formats
- Wildcard matching follows specified semantics
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Redaction preserves content structure
- Redaction log created when domains filtered

MUST NOT:
- Allow non-allowlisted domains when allowlist configured
- Break valid URLs matching allowlist
- Lose content surrounding redacted URLs

#### GP4: allowed-github-references

**Syntax**: `allowed-github-references: [<owner/repo>, ...]`

**Default**: `[]` (empty array, no cross-repository restrictions)

**Semantics**: Specifies allowlist of GitHub repositories for cross-repository safe output operations. When non-empty, operations targeting non-allowlisted repositories are rejected.

**Reference Format**:

Each entry MUST match pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+/[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$`

Examples:
- `github/gh-aw`
- `microsoft/vscode`
- `owner-name/repo.name`

**Validation Behavior**:

When safe output operation includes `target-repo` configuration:
1. Extract target repository from configuration
2. Check if target matches any entry in `allowed-github-references`
3. If no match, reject operation with clear error
4. If match or allowlist empty, proceed with validation

**Same-Repository Operations**:

Operations WITHOUT `target-repo` (same-repository operations) are ALWAYS permitted, regardless of `allowed-github-references` configuration.

*Rationale*: Workflows inherently have permission to operate on their own repository.

**Example Configuration**:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  allowed-github-references:
    - github/roadmap   # Allow operations on roadmap repo
    - github/docs      # Allow operations on docs repo
  
  create-issue:
    target-repo: github/roadmap  # Must be in allowlist
```

**Error Message Format**:

When target repository not in allowlist:
```
Cross-repository operation rejected: target repository not in allowed-github-references

Target: owner/repo
Allowed repositories:
  - github/roadmap
  - github/docs

To permit this operation, add target to allowed-github-references:
  safe-outputs:
    allowed-github-references:
      - owner/repo
```

**Conformance Requirements**:

MUST satisfy:
- Repository reference format validation
- Allowlist checking before API operations
- Clear error messages on rejection
- Same-repository operations always permitted

MUST NOT:
- Allow non-allowlisted cross-repository operations
- Block same-repository operations
- Silently ignore allowlist configuration

### 5.3 Type-Specific Common Parameters

Every safe output type supports these parameters:

#### TS1: max

**Syntax**: `max: <positive-integer> | -1 | null`

**Default**: Type-dependent (see Section 7 for per-type defaults)

**Semantics**: Maximum count of operations permitted for this type in a single workflow run.

**Special Values**:
- Positive integer: Strict limit (e.g., `max: 3` allows up to 3 operations)
- `-1`: Unlimited operations (use with caution)
- `null` or omitted: Use type's default max

**Enforcement Algorithm**:

```javascript
function enforceMaxLimit(operations, type, config) {
  const typeOps = operations.filter(op => op.type === type);
  const maxAllowed = config[type].max;
  
  if (maxAllowed === -1) {
    // Unlimited
    return {allowed: typeOps, rejected: []};
  }
  
  if (typeOps.length > maxAllowed) {
    return {
      allowed: [],
      rejected: typeOps,
      error: \`Exceeded max limit for \${type}: attempted \${typeOps.length}, limit \${maxAllowed}\`
    };
  }
  
  return {allowed: typeOps, rejected: []};
}
```

**Error Reporting**:

When limit exceeded:
```
Safe output limit exceeded for create_issue

Attempted operations: 5
Configured limit: 3

Rejected operations:
  1. "Bug in authentication flow"
  2. "Memory leak in data processor"
  3. "UI rendering issue on mobile"
  4. "Performance degradation after update"
  5. "Documentation outdated"

To increase limit, update workflow configuration:
  safe-outputs:
    create-issue:
      max: 5
```

**Conformance Requirements**:

MUST satisfy:
- Count operations per type independently
- Reject ALL operations when limit exceeded (not just excess)
- Provide clear error with count and limit
- Never silently truncate operations

MUST NOT:
- Accept `max: 0` (invalid; disable type instead)
- Accept negative values except `-1`
- Allow partial execution when limit exceeded

#### TS2: footer (Type-Specific Override)

**Syntax**: `footer: true | false`

**Default**: Inherits from `safe-outputs.footer` (global)

**Semantics**: Override global footer setting for this specific safe output type.

**Inheritance Precedence**:
1. Type-specific `footer` (highest priority)
2. Global `safe-outputs.footer`
3. Default value `true` (lowest priority)

**Example**:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  footer: true  # Global default: footers enabled
  
  create-issue:
    footer: false  # Issues: no footers
  
  add-comment:
    # Inherits global footer: true
```

Result:
- Issues created without footers
- Comments created with footers

#### TS3: staged (Type-Specific Override)

**Syntax**: `staged: true | false`

**Default**: Inherits from `safe-outputs.staged` (global)

**Semantics**: Override global staged setting for this specific safe output type.

**Inheritance Precedence**: Same as footer parameter.

**Example**:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  staged: false  # Global default: normal execution
  
  create-pull-request:
    staged: true  # PRs: preview only
  
  add-labels:
    # Inherits global staged: false (normal execution)
```

Result:
- Pull requests previewed without creation
- Labels applied normally

### 5.4 Type-Specific Extension Parameters

Beyond common parameters, individual safe output types support specialized configuration.

**Representative Examples**:

**Issue Creation Extensions**:
```yaml
create-issue:
  title-prefix: "[AI] "          # Prepend to all titles
  labels: [automation, ai]       # Auto-apply labels
  assignees: [copilot, user1]    # Auto-assign users
  expires: 7                     # Days until auto-close
  group: true                    # Group under parent
  close-older-issues: true       # Close previous workflow issues
  target-repo: owner/repo        # Cross-repository target
  allowed-repos: [owner/repo1]   # Cross-repo allowlist
  allowed-labels: [bug, feature] # Agent label restrictions
```

**Comment Extensions**:
```yaml
add-comment:
  target: "issue" | "pull_request" | "discussion" | "*"
  hide-older-comments: true      # Hide previous workflow comments
  target-repo: owner/repo
  allowed-repos: [...]
```

**Pull Request Extensions**:
```yaml
create-pull-request:
  base-branch: main              # Target branch (default: repo default)
  draft: true                    # Create as draft (default: true)
  commit-changes: true           # Auto-commit workspace changes
  reviewers: [user1, copilot]    # Auto-request reviewers
  labels: [automated]            # Auto-apply labels
```

**Asset Upload Extensions**:
```yaml
upload-asset:
  branch: assets                 # Target branch name
  max-size-kb: 10240             # File size limit (10MB default)
  allowed-extensions: [.png, .jpg, .jpeg]  # Extension allowlist
```

**Discussion Extensions**:
```yaml
create-discussion:
  category: "General"            # Discussion category (name/slug/ID)
  title-prefix: "[Report] "      # Prepend to titles
  labels: [report, automated]    # Auto-apply labels
  allowed-labels: [...]          # Agent label restrictions
```

Complete parameter documentation for each type appears in Section 7.

## 6. Universal Feature Interpretation

This section defines precise semantics for features that apply across multiple safe output types.

### 6.1 Max Limit Semantics

**Feature Identifier**: Maximum Operation Count Constraint  
**Configuration**: `max` parameter on safe output types  
**Scope**: All safe output types

**Normative Requirements**:

**Requirement MR1**: Implementations MUST count operations of each type independently. Cross-type totals are NOT constrained by individual type limits.

**Requirement MR2**: When operation count for a type exceeds configured max, implementations MUST reject ALL operations of that type, not just excess operations.

*Rationale*: All-or-nothing semantics prevent partial execution that may create inconsistent state.

**Requirement MR3**: Rejection MUST occur before any GitHub API invocations for the type.

**Requirement MR4**: Error messages MUST include:
- Safe output type name
- Attempted operation count
- Configured max limit
- List of operation titles/summaries
- Configuration update guidance

**Requirement MR5**: Unlimited semantics (`max: -1`) MUST be supported but SHOULD trigger compilation warnings.

**Conformance Verification**:

Test Case 1: Exact Limit
- Configure `max: 3`
- Declare exactly 3 operations
- Expected: All 3 execute successfully

Test Case 2: Exceeded Limit
- Configure `max: 3`
- Declare 4 operations
- Expected: All 4 rejected with clear error

Test Case 3: Under Limit
- Configure `max: 5`
- Declare 2 operations
- Expected: Both execute successfully

Test Case 4: Unlimited
- Configure `max: -1`
- Declare any count
- Expected: All execute (with warning)

### 6.2 Staged Mode Semantics

**Feature Identifier**: Preview Mode Execution  
**Configuration**: `staged` parameter (global or type-specific)  
**Visual Indicator**: 🎭 emoji  
**Scope**: All safe output types

**Normative Requirements**:

**Requirement SM1**: In staged mode, implementations MUST NOT invoke GitHub API write methods. Read operations for validation are permitted.

**Requirement SM2**: Implementations MUST generate preview summaries containing:
- Operation type and count
- Complete operation details (all fields)
- Formatted representation of content
- Clear indication of preview-only status

**Requirement SM3**: ALL staged mode messages MUST include 🎭 emoji in headings for consistent visual identification.

**Requirement SM4**: Preview format MUST follow this structure:

```markdown
## 🎭 Staged Mode: <Type> Preview

The following <N> <type> operation(s) would be performed if staged mode was disabled:

<Per-operation details>

---
**Preview Summary**: <N> operations previewed. No GitHub resources were created.
```

**Requirement SM5**: Type-specific `staged` settings MUST override global settings according to inheritance rules.

**Conformance Verification**:

Test Case 1: Global Staged
- Configure global `staged: true`
- Declare operations of multiple types
- Expected: All types previewed

Test Case 2: Type-Specific Override
- Configure global `staged: false`, type `staged: true`
- Expected: Type previewed, others execute

Test Case 3: Preview Content
- Enable staged mode
- Declare operation with all fields
- Expected: Preview shows all fields with proper formatting

### 6.3 Footer Attribution Semantics

**Feature Identifier**: AI Attribution Messages  
**Configuration**: `footer` parameter (global or type-specific)  
**Scope**: Content-creating types (issues, discussions, PRs, comments)

**Normative Requirements**:

**Requirement FA1**: Footers MUST be appended to content body, never prepended or inserted mid-content.

**Requirement FA2**: Footers MUST be separated from user content by horizontal rule (`---`).

**Requirement FA3**: Footer MUST include workflow name and clickable run URL.

**Requirement FA4**: When workflow triggered by specific item, footer SHOULD include context reference matching trigger type:
- Issue trigger: `for #<number>`
- PR trigger: `for #<number>`
- Discussion trigger: `for discussion #<number>`

**Requirement FA5**: Installation instructions are OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED when:
- Workflow source is known and public
- Workflow is intended for reuse

**Requirement FA6**: When `footer: false`, implementations MUST NOT append ANY attribution content.

**Requirement FA7**: Type-specific `footer` settings MUST override global settings.

**Footer Template Specification**:

```markdown
---
> AI generated by [<workflow_name>](<run_url>)[<context>]
[>
> To add this workflow in your repository, run `gh aw add <source_path>`. See [usage guide](<docs_url>).]
```

Where:
- `<workflow_name>`: From frontmatter `name:` or derived from filename
- `<run_url>`: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runs/<run_id>`
- `<context>`: Optional: ` for #<N>` or ` for discussion #<N>`
- `<source_path>`: `<owner>/<repo>/<path>@<ref>`
- `<docs_url>`: Documentation URL (typically project docs)

**Conformance Verification**:

Test Case 1: Footer Enabled
- Configure `footer: true`
- Create issue
- Expected: Issue body contains footer with all required elements

Test Case 2: Footer Disabled
- Configure `footer: false`
- Create issue
- Expected: Issue body contains only user content, no footer

Test Case 3: Context Inclusion
- Configure `footer: true`
- Trigger workflow from issue #42
- Create comment
- Expected: Footer includes "for #42"

### 6.4 Content Sanitization Semantics

**Feature Identifier**: Input Security Transformation  
**Scope**: All text fields in all safe output types

**Normative Requirements**:

**Requirement CS1**: ALL user-provided text content MUST undergo sanitization before GitHub API invocation.

**Requirement CS2**: Sanitization MUST apply transformations in this order:
1. Unicode normalization
2. Protocol filtering
3. Domain filtering (if configured)
4. Command neutralization
5. Mention filtering
6. Markdown safety
7. Truncation

**Requirement CS3**: Sanitization MUST be idempotent: `sanitize(sanitize(content)) === sanitize(content)`

**Detailed Transformation Specifications**:

**Transformation T1: Unicode Normalization**

Requirements:
- Apply NFC (Canonical Decomposition + Canonical Composition)
- Remove zero-width characters: U+200B, U+200C, U+200D, U+FEFF
- Remove control characters: U+0000-U+001F, U+007F
- EXCEPT: Preserve U+000A (LF), U+000D (CR), U+0009 (TAB)

**Transformation T2: Protocol Filtering**

Allowed protocols:
- `http://`
- `https://`
- `mailto:`

Requirements:
- Extract URLs via pattern matching
- Check protocol against allowlist
- Replace disallowed protocols: `[URL removed: unauthorized protocol]`
- Malformed protocols: normalize or remove

**Transformation T3: Domain Filtering** (when `allowed-domains` configured)

Requirements:
- Extract domain from each URL
- Compare against allowed-domains list (case-insensitive)
- Wildcard handling: `*.example.com` matches `sub.example.com` but NOT `example.com`
- Replace non-allowed: `[URL redacted: unauthorized domain]`
- Log redacted URLs to `/tmp/gh-aw/safeoutputs/redacted-domains.log`

**Transformation T4: Command Neutralization**

Requirements:
- Detect slash commands at content start: `^/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`
- Escape slash: `/command` becomes `\/command`
- Preserve commands in code blocks

## 7. Safe Output Type Definitions

This section provides complete normative definitions for all safe output types. Each definition includes tool schema, operational semantics, configuration parameters, and security requirements.

### 7.1 Core Issue Operations

#### Type: create_issue

**Purpose**: Create GitHub issues for bug tracking, feature requests, or task management.

**Default Max**: 1  
**Cross-Repository Support**: Yes (via `target-repo`)  
**Mandatory**: Yes (required for full conformance)

**MCP Tool Schema**:

```json
{
  "name": "create_issue",
  "description": "Create a new GitHub issue for tracking bugs, feature requests, or tasks.",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["title", "body"],
    "properties": {
      "title": {"type": "string", "description": "Issue title"},
      "body": {"type": "string", "description": "Issue description in Markdown"},
      "labels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
      "parent": {"type": ["number", "string"], "description": "Parent issue for sub-issues"},
      "temporary_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "pattern": "^aw_[A-Za-z0-9]{3,8}$",
        "description": "Temporary ID for referencing before creation"
      }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

**Operational Semantics**:

1. **Atomicity**: Issue creation is atomic. Failure at any step prevents issue creation.
2. **Temporary ID Resolution**: References to `#aw_<id>` in bodies replaced with actual numbers post-creation.
3. **Parent Linking**: When `parent` specified, tasklist entry added to parent issue.
4. **Label Validation**: Labels must exist in repository; non-existent labels cause failure.
5. **Cross-Repository**: When `target-repo` configured, created in that repository (must be in `allowed-repos`).

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `max`: Operation limit (default: 1)
- `title-prefix`: Prepend to titles
- `labels`: Auto-apply labels
- `assignees`: Auto-assign users/agents
- `expires`: Days until auto-close
- `group`: Group issues under parent
- `close-older-issues`: Close previous workflow issues
- `target-repo`: Cross-repository target
- `allowed-repos`: Cross-repo allowlist
- `allowed-labels`: Agent label restrictions
- `footer`: Footer override
- `staged`: Staged mode override

**Security Requirements**:
- Title and body undergo full sanitization
- Label validation before creation
- Cross-repo validation against allowed-repos
- Expires implemented via scheduled workflow (not client-side)

**Required Permissions**:

*GitHub Actions Token*:
- `contents: read` - Repository metadata and file access
- `issues: write` - Issue creation and modification

*GitHub App* (if using `safe-outputs.app` configuration):
- `issues: write` - Issue creation and modification  
- `metadata: read` - Repository metadata (automatically granted)

**Notes**:
- Both permission modes require the same write scopes
- GitHub App permissions enable cross-repository operations beyond `allowed-repos` when properly configured
- The `contents: read` permission is always included for repository context access

---

#### Type: add_comment

**Purpose**: Add comments to existing issues, pull requests, or discussions.

**Default Max**: 1  
**Cross-Repository Support**: Yes  
**Mandatory**: Yes (required for full conformance)

**MCP Tool Schema**:

```json
{
  "name": "add_comment",
  "description": "Add a comment to an existing issue, pull request, or discussion. IMPORTANT: Comments are subject to validation constraints enforced by the MCP server - maximum 65536 characters for the complete comment (including footer which is added automatically), 10 mentions (@username), and 50 links. Exceeding these limits will result in an immediate error with specific guidance.",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["body"],
    "properties": {
      "body": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Comment text in Markdown. CONSTRAINTS: The complete comment (your body text + automatically added footer) must not exceed 65536 characters total. Maximum 10 mentions (@username), maximum 50 links (http/https URLs). A footer (~200-500 characters) is automatically appended, so leave adequate space. If these limits are exceeded, the tool call will fail with a detailed error message indicating which constraint was violated."
      },
      "item_number": {
        "type": "number",
        "description": "Issue/PR/discussion number (auto-resolved from context if omitted)"
      }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

**Operational Semantics**:

1. **Constraint Enforcement**: The MCP server validates body content before recording operations. Violations trigger immediate error responses with specific guidance (see Section 8.3). The body length limit applies to user-provided content; a second validation occurs after footer addition to ensure the complete comment doesn't exceed limits.
2. **Context Resolution**: When `item_number` omitted, resolves from workflow trigger context.
3. **Related Items**: When multiple outputs created, adds related items section to comments.
4. **Footer Injection**: Appends footer according to configuration (typically 200-500 characters).
5. **Cross-Repository**: Supports `target-repo` configuration.

**Enforced Constraints**:

| Constraint | Limit | Error Code | Example Error Message |
|------------|-------|------------|----------------------|
| Body length (complete comment including footer) | 65536 characters | E006 | "Comment body exceeds maximum length of 65536 characters (got 70000)" |
| Mentions | 10 per comment | E007 | "Comment contains 15 mentions, maximum is 10" |
| Links | 50 per comment | E008 | "Comment contains 60 links, maximum is 50" |

**Note**: The 65536 character limit applies to the final comment text including the automatically appended footer. Users should leave approximately 200-500 characters of headroom to accommodate the footer, which contains workflow attribution and installation instructions.

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `max`: Operation limit (default: 1)
- `target`: Filter by type ("issue", "pull_request", "discussion", "*")
- `hide-older-comments`: Hide previous workflow comments
- `target-repo`: Cross-repository target
- `allowed-repos`: Cross-repo allowlist

**Required Permissions**:

*GitHub Actions Token*:
- `contents: read` - Repository metadata and file access
- `issues: write` - Comment creation on issues
- `pull-requests: write` - Comment creation on pull requests
- `discussions: write` - Comment creation on discussions

*GitHub App* (if using `safe-outputs.app` configuration):
- `issues: write` - Comment creation on issues
- `pull-requests: write` - Comment creation on pull requests
- `discussions: write` - Comment creation on discussions
- `metadata: read` - Repository metadata (automatically granted)

**Notes**:
- Requires write permissions for all three entity types (issues, PRs, discussions) since comments can be added to any type
- Cross-repository commenting requires appropriate permissions in target repository
- The `contents: read` permission is always included for repository context access

---

#### Type: create_pull_request

**Purpose**: Create pull requests to propose code changes.

**Default Max**: 1  
**Cross-Repository Support**: No (same-repository only)  
**Mandatory**: Yes (required for full conformance)

**MCP Tool Schema**:

```json
{
  "name": "create_pull_request",
  "description": "Create a new pull request to propose code changes.",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["title", "body"],
    "properties": {
      "title": {"type": "string"},
      "body": {"type": "string"},
      "branch": {"type": "string", "description": "Source branch (defaults to current)"},
      "labels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
      "draft": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Create as draft (default: true)"}
    },
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

**Operational Semantics**:

1. **Branch Validation**: Source branch must exist and contain changes.
2. **Base Branch**: Defaults to repository default branch.
3. **Draft Status**: Creates as draft by default for safety.
4. **Auto-Commit**: When `commit-changes: true`, commits workspace changes before PR creation.
5. **Reviewer Assignment**: Auto-requests reviewers if configured.

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `max`: Operation limit (default: 1)
- `base-branch`: Target branch
- `draft`: Draft status
- `commit-changes`: Auto-commit workspace
- `reviewers`: Auto-request reviewers
- `labels`: Auto-apply labels
- `title-prefix`: Prepend to titles
- `footer`: Footer override

**Security Requirements**:
- Branch name sanitization (prevent injection)
- Patch content validation
- Size limits on commits

**Required Permissions**:

*GitHub Actions Token*:
- `contents: write` - Branch creation and commit operations
- `pull-requests: write` - Pull request creation

**With `fallback-as-issue: true`** (default):
- `contents: write` - Branch creation and commit operations
- `issues: write` - Issue creation fallback when PR creation fails
- `pull-requests: write` - Pull request creation

*GitHub App* (if using `safe-outputs.app` configuration):

- `contents: write` - Branch creation and commit operations
- `issues: write` - Issue creation fallback when PR creation fails
- `pull-requests: write` - Pull request creation
- `metadata: read` - Repository metadata (automatically granted)

**Notes**:
- Permission requirements vary based on `fallback-as-issue` configuration
- When `fallback-as-issue: true` (default), requires `issues: write` for fallback issue creation if PR creation fails
- When `fallback-as-issue: false`, only requires `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`
- Cross-repository pull requests are not supported - operations are limited to same repository

### 7.2 System Types

#### Type: noop

**Purpose**: Log workflow completion message for transparency.

**Default Max**: 1  
**Cross-Repository Support**: N/A (no external operations)  
**Mandatory**: Yes (always enabled, cannot be disabled)

    "properties": {
      "message": {"type": "string", "description": "Completion message (default provided)"}
    },
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

**Operational Semantics**:

1. **Always Enabled**: Automatically registered in every workflow.
2. **Execution Order**: Always executes last for summary generation.
3. **No Side Effects**: Creates no GitHub resources.
4. **Transparency**: Provides clear indication of normal completion vs. error states.

## 8. Protocol Exchange Patterns

### 8.1 HTTP Transport Layer

**Protocol**: HTTP/1.1  
**Bind Address**: 127.0.0.1 (localhost only)  
**Port**: From `GH_AW_SAFE_OUTPUTS_PORT` (default: 3001)  
**Operation Mode**: Stateless (no session management)

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /tools/list` - List available tools
- `POST /tools/call` - Invoke tool

### 8.2 Tool Invocation Protocol

**Request Format**:
```http
POST /tools/call HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:3001
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "<tool_name>",
    "arguments": {<parameters>}
  }
}
```

**Success Response**:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "result": {
    "content": [{
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\"result\":\"success\"}"
    }]
  }
}
```

**Validation Error**:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Invalid params: <details>"
  }
}
```

### 8.3 MCP Server Constraint Enforcement

**Requirement MCE1: Early Validation**

MCP servers MUST enforce operational constraints during tool invocation (Phase 4) rather than deferring all validation to safe output processing (Phase 6). This provides immediate feedback to the LLM, enabling corrective action before operations are recorded to NDJSON.

**Constraint Categories**:

1. **Length Limits**: Character count restrictions on text fields
2. **Entity Limits**: Maximum counts for mentions, links, or other entities
3. **Format Requirements**: Pattern validation, encoding checks
4. **Business Rules**: Type-specific constraints based on safe output configuration

**Requirement MCE2: Tool Description Disclosure**

Tool descriptions (MCP tool schemas) MUST surface enforced constraints to the LLM through the `description` field. This enables the LLM to self-regulate and avoid constraint violations.

**Example - add_comment constraints**:

```json
{
  "name": "add_comment",
  "description": "Add a comment to an existing GitHub issue, pull request, or discussion. IMPORTANT: Comments are subject to validation constraints enforced by the MCP server - maximum 65536 characters for the complete comment (including footer which is added automatically), 10 mentions (@username), and 50 links. Exceeding these limits will result in an immediate error with specific guidance.",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "body": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The comment text in Markdown format. CONSTRAINTS: The complete comment (your body text + automatically added footer) must not exceed 65536 characters total. A footer (~200-500 characters) is automatically appended, so leave adequate space. Maximum 10 mentions (@username), maximum 50 links (http/https URLs). If these limits are exceeded, the tool call will fail with a detailed error message indicating which constraint was violated."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Requirement MCE3: Actionable Error Responses**

When constraints are violated, MCP servers MUST return error responses that:

1. **Identify the violated constraint** with specific name and limit
2. **Report the actual value** that triggered the violation
3. **Provide remediation guidance** on how to correct the issue
4. **Use standard error codes** (E006-E008 for add_comment limits)

**Example - Mention Limit Violation**:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "E007: Comment contains 15 mentions, maximum is 10",
    "data": {
      "constraint": "max_mentions",
      "limit": 10,
      "actual": 15,
      "guidance": "Reduce the number of @mentions in your comment to 10 or fewer. Consider tagging only essential participants."
    }
  }
}
```

**Requirement MCE4: Dual Enforcement**

Constraints MUST be enforced at both invocation time (MCP server) and processing time (safe output processor) to provide defense-in-depth:

- **MCP Server Enforcement**: Provides immediate LLM feedback during agent execution
- **Processor Enforcement**: Validates operations recorded to NDJSON as final safety check

This dual enforcement pattern ensures constraints cannot be bypassed through malformed NDJSON or direct artifact manipulation.

**Implementation Pattern**:

```javascript
// MCP Server - Immediate validation during tool call
function handleAddComment(args) {
  enforceCommentLimits(args.body); // Throws if limits exceeded
  recordOperation('add_comment', args);
  return {result: {content: [{type: "text", text: '{"result":"success"}'}]}};
}

// Safe Output Processor - Final validation before API call  
async function processAddComment(operation) {
  enforceCommentLimits(operation.body); // Defense-in-depth
  const sanitized = sanitizeContent(operation);
  await github.rest.issues.createComment(sanitized);
}
```

**Requirement MCE5: Constraint Configuration Consistency**

Constraint limits defined in MCP tool descriptions MUST match the enforcement logic in both the MCP server and safe output processor implementations. Inconsistent limits between these components violate the specification.

**Verification**:
- **Method**: Code review and integration testing
- **Tool**: Automated tests comparing tool descriptions to handler enforcement code
- **Criteria**: All constraint limits are identical across tool schema, MCP server, and processor

**Example Constraints for Common Safe Output Types**:

| Type | Constraint | Limit | Error Code |
|------|-----------|-------|------------|
| `add_comment` | Body length (complete comment with footer) | 65536 chars | E006 |
| `add_comment` | Mentions | 10 | E007 |
| `add_comment` | Links | 50 | E008 |
| `create_issue` | Title length | 256 chars | E009 |
| `create_issue` | Body length (complete body with footer) | 65536 chars | E006 |
| `create_pull_request` | Title length | 256 chars | E009 |
| `create_pull_request` | Body length (complete body with footer) | 65536 chars | E006 |

**Note**: For operations that append footers (comments, issues, pull requests), the character limit applies to the complete text including the automatically added footer. Users should reserve approximately 200-500 characters to accommodate the footer.

**Rationale**: Early constraint enforcement transforms validation failures from post-execution errors (requiring workflow reruns) into correctable feedback during agent reasoning. This improves agent effectiveness by enabling iterative refinement and reduces wasted compute on operations that will ultimately fail validation.

### 8.4 NDJSON Persistence

**File**: `/tmp/gh-aw/safeoutputs/output.ndjson`  
**Format**: One JSON object per line  
**Encoding**: UTF-8

**Entry Structure**:
```json
{"type":"<safe_output_type>","<param1>":"<value1>"}
```

**Parsing**:
- Read line-by-line
- Parse each line independently
- Ignore empty lines
- Validate `type` field presence

---

## 9. Content Integrity Mechanisms

### 9.1 Schema Validation

All tool invocations MUST validate against JSON Schema Draft 7.

**Validation Process**:
1. Parse invocation arguments
2. Load tool schema
3. Validate against schema
4. Report all errors with paths

**Error Format**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Invalid params",
    "data": {
      "errors": [
        {"path": "/title", "message": "Missing required field"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 9.2 Cross-Field Validation

Some validations span multiple fields:
- Conditional requirements (e.g., `discussion_number` required when target is "*")
- Range constraints (e.g., `start_line < line` in review comments)
- Mutual exclusivity checks

### 9.3 Repository Feature Validation

Operations requiring repository features must validate availability:
- Issues enabled
- Discussions enabled
- Projects enabled

Validation occurs during execution, not tool invocation.

### 9.4 Content Sanitization Pipeline

**Applicability**

Content sanitization MUST be applied to all user-provided text fields in safe output operations. Text fields include:
- `title` (issues, PRs, discussions, projects)
- `body` (issues, PRs, discussions, comments)
- `description` (projects, status updates)
- `comment` (review comments)

**Sanitization Stages**

Implementations MUST apply these transformations in order:

**S1: Null Byte Removal**
- Remove all null bytes (`\0`, `\x00`) from strings
- Rationale: Prevents string truncation attacks

**S2: Markdown Link Validation**
- Pattern: `[text](url)` and `<url>`
- For each URL:
  - Extract domain
  - If `allowed-domains` is configured:
    - Check domain against allowlist
    - If not allowed: Replace with `[text]([URL redacted: unauthorized domain])`
  - Log redacted URLs to `/tmp/gh-aw/safeoutputs/redacted-domains.log`

**S3: Markdown Image Validation**
- Pattern: `![alt](url)`
- For each image URL:
  - Extract domain
  - If `allowed-domains` is configured:
    - Check domain against allowlist
    - If not allowed: Replace with `![alt]([Image URL redacted: unauthorized domain])`

**S4: HTML Tag Filtering** (Optional, depends on field type)
- Remove potentially dangerous tags:
  - `<script>`, `</script>`
  - `<iframe>`, `</iframe>`
  - `<object>`, `</object>`
  - `<embed>`, `</embed>`
- Remove event handlers:
  - `on*` attributes in HTML tags (onclick, onerror, etc.)
- Preserve safe GitHub Flavored Markdown tags:
  - `<details>`, `<summary>`, `<sub>`, `<sup>`, `<kbd>`

**S5: Command Injection Prevention**
- Do NOT execute or interpret code blocks
- Do NOT evaluate template expressions
- Preserve code blocks verbatim (no escaping needed in markdown)

**Excluded Content**

The following content MUST NOT be sanitized:
- Code blocks (` ``` `)
- Inline code (`` `code` ``)
- System-generated footers
- System-generated metadata

**Sanitization Reversibility**

Sanitization transformations are LOSSY and NOT reversible. Original content is not preserved after sanitization. This is intentional to prevent attempts to bypass sanitization.

**Conformance Requirement CR1: Pre-API Sanitization**

All content MUST be sanitized BEFORE GitHub API invocation. Unsanitized content MUST NEVER be passed to GitHub APIs.

*Verification*: Inspect handler code to confirm sanitization occurs before `octokit.*` calls.

### 9.5 Error Code Catalog

Implementations MUST use standardized error codes for validation and execution failures.

**Error Code Table**

| Code | Name | Description | When to Use | HTTP Status Equivalent |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|------------------------|
| E001 | INVALID_SCHEMA | Operation failed JSON schema validation | Input does not match type-specific schema | 400 Bad Request |
| E002 | LIMIT_EXCEEDED | Operation count exceeds configured max | Batch contains more operations than allowed | 429 Too Many Requests |
| E003 | UNAUTHORIZED_DOMAIN | URL contains non-allowlisted domain | Domain filtering rejected URL | 403 Forbidden |
| E004 | INVALID_TARGET_REPO | target-repo not in allowed-repos | Cross-repository validation failed | 403 Forbidden |
| E005 | MISSING_PARENT | Referenced parent issue/PR not found | Temporary ID or parent reference cannot be resolved | 404 Not Found |
| E006 | INVALID_LABEL | Label does not exist in repository | Label validation failed | 404 Not Found |
| E007 | API_ERROR | GitHub API returned error | GitHub API call failed | 502 Bad Gateway |
| E008 | SANITIZATION_FAILED | Content contains unsanitizable unsafe patterns | Sanitization pipeline detected unremovable threats | 422 Unprocessable Entity |
| E009 | CONFIG_HASH_MISMATCH | Configuration hash verification failed | Workflow YAML was modified after compilation | 403 Forbidden |
| E010 | RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED | GitHub API rate limit exceeded | Too many API calls | 429 Too Many Requests |

**Error Message Format**

All errors MUST conform to this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "E002",
    "name": "LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "Operation count exceeds configured limit",
    "details": {
      "type": "create_issue",
      "attempted": 5,
      "max": 3,
      "operation_index": 3
    },
    "timestamp": "2026-02-14T16:39:20.948Z",
    "workflow_run": "https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/12345"
  }
}
```

**Required Fields**:
- `code`: Error code from table above (E001-E010)
- `name`: Error name from table above
- `message`: Human-readable description
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp

**Optional Fields**:
- `details`: Type-specific error context (operation_index, field names, etc.)
- `workflow_run`: URL to workflow run for provenance

**Error Handling Requirements**

**Requirement EH1: Early Failure Detection**

Validation errors (E001-E006) MUST be detected before any GitHub API calls are made.

**Requirement EH2: Clear Error Messages**

Error messages MUST:
- Clearly state what went wrong
- Include enough context to debug (field names, values)
- Suggest remediation when possible

**Requirement EH3: Error Logging**

All errors MUST be logged to:
- GitHub Actions step output (visible in workflow run)
- Job summary (visible in workflow run summary)
- STDERR (for local development)

## 10. Execution Guarantees

### 10.1 Atomicity

**Single-Item Operations**: Complete success or complete failure (no partial state).

**Batch Operations**: Best-effort semantics; partial success reported.

### 10.2 Ordering

Operations execute in:
1. NDJSON file order
2. Type grouping (same type together)
3. System types last (noop)

### 10.3 Idempotency

**Idempotent Operations**:
- add_labels (adding present label)
- remove_labels (removing absent label)
- hide_comment (hiding hidden comment)

**Non-Idempotent Operations**:
- create_issue
- create_discussion
- add_comment

### 10.4 Error Handling

**Fail-Safe Principle**: One operation's failure doesn't prevent others from attempting.

**Error Reporting**: All errors collected; execution summary reports per-type results.

### 10.5 Edge Case Behavior

This section defines required behavior for unusual or boundary conditions.

**Empty Operations**

*Scenario*: NDJSON artifact contains zero operations

*Behavior*:
- Safe output job MUST succeed (exit code 0)
- Job summary SHOULD display: "✅ No operations to process"
- No GitHub API calls are made
- No errors are raised

*Rationale*: Empty operations are valid (agent may determine no action is needed).

**Zero Max Limit**

*Scenario*: Configuration specifies `max: 0` for a safe output type

*Behavior*:
- Type is DISABLED (MCP tool is not registered)
- Attempts to invoke disabled type MUST return MCP error:
  ```json
  {"error": {"code": -32601, "message": "Method not found"}}
  ```
- No configuration is generated for disabled types

*Rationale*: `max: 0` is an explicit disable signal.

**API Rate Limiting**

*Scenario*: GitHub API returns 429 (rate limit exceeded) or 403 with X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0

*Behavior*:
- Processor MUST retry with exponential backoff:
  - 1st retry: After 60 seconds
  - 2nd retry: After 120 seconds  
  - 3rd retry: After 240 seconds
- After 3 retries, MUST fail with E010 error
- Error details MUST include rate limit reset time from `X-RateLimit-Reset` header

*Rationale*: Transient rate limits should not fail workflows unnecessarily.

**Workflow Cancellation**

*Scenario*: Workflow is manually cancelled during agent execution

*Behavior*:
- Safe output job MUST NOT execute if artifact upload was interrupted
- Partial NDJSON artifacts MUST NOT be processed
- GitHub Actions automatically handles cleanup
- No additional logic required in handlers

*Rationale*: GitHub Actions cancellation is handled at platform level.

**Concurrent Workflow Runs**

*Scenario*: Multiple workflow runs execute concurrently for the same workflow

*Behavior*:
- Each run operates independently
- Max limits are per-run (NOT global across runs)
- No coordination or locking between runs
- Operations in separate runs do NOT affect each other's limits

*Rationale*: Simplicity and avoiding distributed coordination complexity.

**Malformed NDJSON**

*Scenario*: NDJSON artifact contains invalid JSON on one or more lines

*Behavior*:
- Parser MUST skip invalid lines with warning
- Valid lines MUST be processed
- Job summary MUST show: "⚠️ Skipped N malformed entries"
- Invalid lines MUST be logged to STDERR

*Rationale*: Partial failure should not prevent valid operations from executing.

**Missing Artifact**

*Scenario*: Safe output job cannot download artifact (artifact not found)

*Behavior*:
- Job MUST fail with clear error message
- Error MUST suggest checking agent job completion
- Exit code MUST be non-zero

*Rationale*: Missing artifact indicates upstream failure that must be addressed.

**Duplicate Temporary IDs**

*Scenario*: Multiple operations use the same `temporary_id`

*Behavior*:
- First operation using the ID succeeds and establishes mapping
- Subsequent operations using the same ID MUST reference the first operation's result
- If this creates ambiguity (e.g., two issues both want to be "aw_parent"), MUST reject with E005

*Rationale*: Deterministic behavior prevents confusion.

## Appendix G: Configuration Patterns

This appendix provides common configuration patterns for safe outputs.

### Pattern 1: Simple Issue Tracking

Basic configuration for automated issue creation:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    max: 1
    labels: [automated]
```

**Use case**: Single automated issue per workflow run with consistent labeling.

### Pattern 2: Multi-Type with Global Footer

Configuration with multiple output types sharing global settings:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  footer: true  # Applied to all types
  
  create-issue:
    max: 3
    labels: [bug, automated]
  
  add-comment:
    max: 2
    hide-older-comments: true
```

**Use case**: Workflow creating multiple issues and comments with attribution footers.

### Pattern 3: Cross-Repository Operations

Secure cross-repository issue creation:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  allowed-github-references:
    - owner/repo-a
    - owner/repo-b
  
  create-issue:
    max: 5
    target-repo: owner/repo-a
```

**Use case**: Creating issues in a central tracking repository from multiple workflow repositories.

**Security note**: Explicit allowlist prevents unauthorized repository targeting.

### Pattern 4: Staged Mode Development

Safe testing in preview mode:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  staged: true  # Enable preview mode globally
  
  create-issue:
    max: 10  # Safe to set high in staged mode
  
  add-comment:
    max: 5
```

**Use case**: Testing workflow behavior without creating real GitHub resources.

**Workflow**: Test with `staged: true`, verify previews, then deploy with `staged: false`.

### Pattern 5: Type-Specific Allowlists

Fine-grained cross-repository control:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  allowed-github-references: [owner/repo-a, owner/repo-b]
  
  create-issue:
    allowed-repos: [owner/repo-c]  # Overrides global
    max: 3
    
  add-comment:
    # No type-specific list, uses global: repo-a, repo-b
    max: 2
```

**Use case**: Different safe output types target different repositories.

**Security note**: Type-specific allowlists override global allowlists.

### Pattern 6: Domain Filtering for Security

Restrict URLs in safe output content:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  allowed-domains:
    - github.com
    - "*.github.io"
    - docs.github.com
  
  create-issue:
    max: 5
```

**Use case**: Prevent agents from including unauthorized URLs in created content.

**Effect**: URLs to non-allowlisted domains are redacted during sanitization.

### Pattern 7: Temporary Resource Cleanup

Auto-close temporary issues:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    max: 10
    expires: 7  # Auto-close after 7 days
    labels: [temporary, automated]
```

**Use case**: Issues for transient notifications that should auto-clean.

**Implementation**: Scheduled workflow checks issue age and closes expired issues.

### Pattern 8: Review Comment Workflow

Pull request review automation with reply support:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-pr-review-comment:
    max: 20
    
  submit-pr-review:
    max: 1
    
  reply-to-pull-request-review-comment:
    max: 10
    
  resolve-pr-review-thread:
    max: 10
```

**Use case**: Automated code review with inline comments, review replies, and thread resolution.

**Workflow**: Create review comments, submit bundled review, reply to reviewer feedback, resolve addressed threads.

### Pattern 9: Project Management

Automated project creation and updates:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-project:
    max: 1
    
  update-project:
    max: 5
    
  create-project-status-update:
    max: 3
```

**Use case**: Creating and maintaining project boards automatically.

### Pattern 10: Grouped Issues with Parent

Create related issues under a parent:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    max: 10
    group: true
```

**Use case**: Workflow creates parent issue and multiple sub-issues linked via tasklists.

**Effect**: First issue becomes parent, subsequent issues link to it.

### Best Practices

**Start Conservative**:
- Begin with low `max` values
- Enable `staged: true` for testing
- Use explicit `allowed-repos` lists

**Use Domain Filtering**:
- Always configure `allowed-domains` when agents process external input
- Include only trusted domains

**Enable Footers**:
- Keep `footer: true` (default) for transparency
- Only disable when absolutely necessary

**Temporary Resources**:
- Use `expires` for transient issues
- Clean up with `close-older-issues` for superseded content

**Cross-Repository Security**:
- Use type-specific `allowed-repos` for fine-grained control
- Prefer explicit lists over broad permissions

## Appendix F: Document History

**Version 1.12.0** (2026-02-16):
- **Implemented**: MCE1 (Early Validation) for add_comment tool with MCP server constraint enforcement
- **Added**: Runtime validation in safe_outputs_handlers.cjs that enforces comment limits during tool invocation
- **Verified**: Dual enforcement pattern now operational - MCP server validates during Phase 4, safe output processor validates during Phase 6
- **Enhanced**: Error responses now use JSON-RPC error code -32602 with actionable messages containing specific constraint details
- **Tested**: Comprehensive test suite (16 test cases) validates E006/E007/E008 error handling and MCP error format compliance

**Version 1.11.0** (2026-02-15):
- **Added**: Section 8.3 "MCP Server Constraint Enforcement" specifying requirements for early validation during tool invocation (MCE1-MCE5)
- **Enhanced**: Tool descriptions to surface operational constraints to the LLM (e.g., add_comment mention/link/length limits)
- **Clarified**: Dual enforcement pattern requiring validation at both MCP server and safe output processor layers
- **Added**: Constraint consistency requirement (MCE5) ensuring limits are identical across tool schemas and enforcement code
- **Added**: Example constraint table for common safe output types with error codes
- **Updated**: add_comment tool description in safe_outputs_tools.json to include explicit constraint documentation

**Version 1.10.0** (2026-02-14):
- **Added**: `reply_to_pull_request_review_comment` safe output type definition (Section 7.3)
- **Updated**: Pattern 8 (Review Comment Workflow) to include reply-to-review-comment in example configuration

**Version 1.9.0** (2026-02-14):
- Added comprehensive validation pipeline ordering (7 stages)
- Added cross-repository security model with explicit allowlist rules
- Added content sanitization pipeline specification (5 stages)
- Added standardized error code catalog (E001-E010)
- Added edge case behavior specifications
- Added terminology section for consistency
- Enhanced security properties (SP6, SP7)
- Improved requirements testability

**Version 1.8.0** (2025-02-14):
- Initial W3C-style specification release
- Complete security model documentation
- Comprehensive safe output type catalog
- Protocol exchange pattern definitions
