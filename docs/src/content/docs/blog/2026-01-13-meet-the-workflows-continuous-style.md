Welcome back to [Peli's Agent Factory](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/)!

In our [previous posts](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-13-meet-the-workflows-continuous-simplicity/), we've explored how autonomous cleanup agents work continuously in the background, simplifying code and improving structure. Today's post is dedicated to one agent, and the larger admirable concept it represents: continuously making things *beautiful*.

## A Continuous Style Workflow

Today's post is dedicated to one agent, and the larger concept it represents: the **[Terminal Stylist](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/terminal-stylist.md?plain=1)** workflow. This agent's purpose is to **make things look better**, by reviewing and enhancing the style of command-line interface (CLI) output.

Command-line interfaces are a primary interaction point for developer tools. When output is inconsistent or noisy, it still “works,” but it adds friction. When it’s well-styled, information becomes scannable, color highlights what matters, layouts remain readable across light and dark themes, and the overall experience feels professional.

Under the hood, the workflow looks for non-test Go files with console-related code and patterns such as `fmt.Print*`, `console.*`, and Lipgloss usage. It then checks for consistency in formatting helpers (especially for errors), sensible TTY-aware rendering, and accessible color choices. When it finds rough edges, it proposes concrete improvements, such as replacing plain output like `fmt.Println("Error: compilation failed")` with `fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, console.FormatErrorMessage("Compilation failed"))`, or swapping ad-hoc ANSI coloring for adaptive Lipgloss styles.

Rather than opening issues or PRs, the Terminal Stylist posts GitHub Discussions in the "General" category. Styling changes are often subjective, and discussions make it easier to converge on the right balance between simplicity and polish.

Terminal Stylist demonstrates multi-agent collaboration at its best. The workflow created **31 daily analysis reports** as discussions, which were then mined by Discussion Task Miner and Plan Command into **25 actionable issues**. Those issues spawned **16 merged PRs (80% merge rate)** improving console output across the codebase - from [Charmbracelet best practices adoption](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/pull/9928) to [progress bars](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/pull/8731) to [stderr routing fixes](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/pull/12302). Terminal Stylist never creates PRs directly; instead, it identifies opportunities that other agents implement, showing how workflows can collaborate through GitHub's discussion → issue → PR pipeline.

The Terminal Stylist is proof that autonomous cleanup agents can have surprisingly specific taste. It focuses on terminal UI craft, using the Charmbracelet ecosystem (especially Lipgloss and Huh) to keep the CLI not just correct, but pleasant to use.

## The Art of Continuous Style

The Terminal Stylist shows that autonomous improvement isn’t limited to structure and correctness; it also covers user experience. By continuously reviewing output patterns, it helps new features match the project’s visual language, keeps styling aligned with evolving libraries, and nudges the CLI toward accessibility and clarity.

This is especially useful in AI-assisted development, where quick suggestions tend to default to `fmt.Println`. The Terminal Stylist cleans up after the AI, bringing that output back in line with the project’s conventions.

Continuous Style is a new frontier in code quality. It recognizes that how code *looks* matters just as much as how it *works*. By automating style reviews, we ensure that every interaction with our tools feels polished and professional.

## Using These Workflows

You can add this workflow to your own repository and remix it as follows:

**Terminal Stylist:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/terminal-stylist.md
```

Then edit and remix the workflow specification to meet your needs, regenerate the lock file using `gh aw compile`, and push to your repository. See our [Quick Start](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/) for further installation and setup instructions.

You can also [create your own workflows](/gh-aw/setup/creating-workflows).

## Next Up: Continuous Improvement

Beyond simplicity, structure, and style, there's a final dimension: holistic quality improvement. How do we analyze dependencies, type safety, and overall repository health?
