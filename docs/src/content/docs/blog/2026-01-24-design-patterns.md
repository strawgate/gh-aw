*My dear friends!* What a scrumptious third helping in the Peli's Agent Factory series! You've sampled the [workflows](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-13-meet-the-workflows/) and savored the [lessons we've learned](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-21-twelve-lessons/) - now prepare yourselves for the *secret recipes* - the fundamental design patterns that emerged from running our collection!

After building our collection of agents in Peli's Agent Factory, we started noticing patterns. Not the kind we planned upfront - these emerged organically from solving real problems. Now we've identified 12 fundamental design patterns that capture what successful agentic workflows actually do.

Think of these patterns as architectural blueprints for agents. Every workflow in the factory fits into at least one pattern, and many combine several. Understanding these patterns will help you design effective agents faster, without reinventing the wheel.

Let's dive in!

## Pattern 1: The Read-Only Analyst

**Observe, analyze, and report - without changing anything**

These agents gather data, perform analysis, and publish insights through discussions or assets. They have zero write permissions to code. This makes them incredibly safe to run continuously at any frequency.

Use these when:

- Building confidence in agent behavior (great for getting started!)
- Establishing baselines before automation
- Generating reports and metrics
- Deep research and investigation

Here are some examples:

- [`audit-workflows`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/audit-workflows.md) - Meta-agent that audits all other agents' runs
- [`portfolio-analyst`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/portfolio-analyst.md) - Spots cost optimization opportunities
- [`session-insights`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/copilot-session-insights.md) - Analyzes Copilot usage patterns
- [`org-health-report`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/org-health-report.md) - Organization-wide health metrics
- [`scout`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/scout.md), [`archie`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/archie.md) - Deep research agents

Some key characteristics are:

- `permissions: contents: read` only (that's it!)
- Output via discussions, issues, or artifact uploads
- Can run on any schedule without risk
- Builds trust through transparency
- Often creates visualizations and charts

---

## Pattern 2: The ChatOps Responder

**On-demand assistance via slash commands**

These agentic workflows areactivated by `/command` mentions in issues or PRs. Role-gated for security. They respond with analysis, visualizations, or actions.

Use these when:

- Interactive code reviews
- On-demand optimizations
- User-initiated research
- Specialized assistance requiring authorization

Here are some examples:

- [`q`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/q.md) - Workflow optimizer (type `/q` and it investigates!)
- [`grumpy-reviewer`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/grumpy-reviewer.md) - Critical code review with personality
- [`poem-bot`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/poem-bot.md) - Creative verse generation (because why not?)
- [`mergefest`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/mergefest.md) - Branch merging automation
- [`pr-fix`](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/pr-fix.md) - Fixes failing CI checks on demand

Some key characteristics are:

- Triggered by `/command` in issue/PR comments
- Often includes role-gating for security
- Provides immediate feedback
- Uses cache-memory to avoid duplicate work
- Clear personality and purpose

- [`glossary-maintainer`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/glossary-maintainer.md) - Syncs glossary with codebase
- [`daily-file-diet`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/daily-file-diet.md) - Refactors oversized files
- [`hourly-ci-cleaner`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/hourly-ci-cleaner.md) - Repairs CI issues

Some key characteristics are:

- Runs on fixed schedules
- Creates PRs for human review (no auto-merge!)
- Makes small, focused changes
- Uses descriptive labels and commits
- Often includes "if no changes" guards

---

## Pattern 4: The Quality Guardian

- Schema consistency checks
- Infrastructure health monitoring

Here are some examples:

- Smoke tests for [`copilot`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/smoke-copilot.md), [`claude`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/smoke-claude.md), [`codex`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/smoke-codex.md)

- Often includes intelligent classification
- Maintains issue relationships
- Respects user intent and context
- **For public repo triage**: May need [lockdown mode disabled](/gh-aw/reference/lockdown-mode/) to process issues from all users

---

## Pattern 6: The Multi-Phase Improver

**Progressive work across multiple days with human checkpoints**

These agentic workflows tackle complex improvements too large for single runs. Three phases: (1) Research and create plan discussion, (2) Infer/setup build infrastructure, (3) Implement changes via PR. Check state each run to determine current phase.

Use these when:

- Large refactoring projects
- Test coverage improvements
- Performance optimization

Use these when:

- Keeping docs synchronized
- Maintaining glossaries
- Updating slide decks
- Analyzing multimedia content
- Generating documentation

Here are some examples:

- [`glossary-maintainer`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/glossary-maintainer.md) - Glossary synchronization

- Often dispatcher-based

---

## Pattern 11: The ML & Analytics Agent

**Advanced insights through machine learning and NLP**

These agentic workflows apply clustering, NLP, statistical analysis, or ML techniques to extract patterns from historical data. Generate visualizations and trend reports.

Use these when:

- Pattern discovery in large datasets
- NLP on conversations
- Clustering similar items
- Trend analysis
- Longitudinal studies

Here are some examples:

- Spam and abuse prevention
- Compliance enforcement
- Security fix generation

Here are some examples:

- [`security-compliance`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/security-compliance.md) - Vulnerability campaigns

Some key characteristics are:

- Security-focused permissions
- High accuracy requirements
- Often regulatory-driven
- Creates actionable alerts
- May include auto-remediation

---

## Combining Patterns

Here's where it gets fun: many successful workflows combine multiple patterns. For example:

- **Read-Only Analyst + ML Analytics** - Analyze historical data and generate insights
- **ChatOps Responder + Multi-Phase Improver** - User triggers a multi-day improvement project
- **Quality Guardian + Security Agent** - Validate both quality and security continuously
- **Meta-Agent Optimizer + Meta-Agent Orchestrator** - Monitor and coordinate the ecosystem

## Choosing the Right Pattern

When designing a new agent, ask yourself:

1. **Does it modify anything?** → If no, start with Read-Only Analyst (safest!)
2. **Is it user-triggered?** → Consider ChatOps Responder
3. **Should it run automatically?** → Choose between Janitor (PRs) or Guardian (validation)
4. **Is it managing other agents?** → Use Meta-Agent Optimizer or Orchestrator
5. **Does it need multiple phases?** → Use Multi-Phase Improver
6. **Is it security-related?** → Apply Security & Moderation pattern

## What's Next?

These design patterns describe *what* agents do behaviorally. But *how* they operate within GitHub's ecosystem - that requires understanding operational patterns.

In our next article, we'll explore 9 operational patterns for running agents effectively on GitHub. These are the strategies that make agents work in practice!
