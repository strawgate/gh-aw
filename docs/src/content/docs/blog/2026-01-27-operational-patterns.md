*Marvelous timing!* You've returned to our ongoing series about Peli's Agent Factory! Having explored the [secret recipes](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-24-design-patterns/) that define what agents do, we now venture into the *operational theater* - where theory meets practice!

So you've learned what agents *do* (design patterns), but how do they actually *operate* in GitHub's ecosystem? That's where operational patterns come in.

These patterns emerged from building and running workflows at scale - they're battle-tested approaches to common challenges. While design patterns describe agent architecture, operational patterns describe how agents integrate with GitHub's workflow, issue, project, and event systems to create effective automation.

Let's explore 9 operational patterns that make agents work in practice!

## Pattern 1: ChatOps - Command-Driven Interactions

These workflows are triggered by slash commands (`/review`, `/deploy`, `/fix`) in issue or PR comments. This creates an interactive conversation interface where team members can invoke powerful AI capabilities with simple commands.

Use these when:

- Code reviews on demand
- Performance investigations
- Bug fixes and optimizations
- Research and documentation requests
- Any operation requiring user authorization

These workflows do the following:

1. User comments `/command` on an issue or PR
2. Workflow triggers on `issue_comment` or `pull_request_comment` event
3. Comment gets parsed for command and parameters
4. Role-gating validates user permissions
5. Agent executes and responds in thread
6. Cache-memory prevents duplicate work

### Example: Grumpy Reviewer

The [`grumpy-reviewer`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/grumpy-reviewer.md) workflow is a perfect example of this pattern:

- Triggered by `/grumpy` on PR comments
- Performs critical code review with distinctive personality
- Uses cache memory to avoid duplicate feedback
- Role-gated to prevent abuse
- Responds directly in PR thread

The key benefits are:

- Natural, conversational interface
- Role-based access control built-in
- Context-aware (knows which issue/PR)
- Immediate feedback
- Audit trail in comments

Here are our tips!

- Use clear, memorable command names
- Document commands in README
- Implement role-gating for sensitive operations
- Add help text for `/command help`
- Use cache-memory to track command history

## Pattern 2: DailyOps - Scheduled Incremental Progress

Workflows that run on weekday schedules to make small, daily progress toward large goals. Instead of overwhelming teams with major changes, work happens automatically in manageable pieces that are easy to review and integrate.

Use these when:

- Test coverage improvements
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates
- Technical debt reduction
- Dependency management

These workflows do the following:

1. Workflow runs on schedule (e.g., `0 9 * * 1-5` for weekdays at 9am)
2. Agent checks state from previous runs
3. Makes incremental progress (1-3 small changes)
4. Creates PR or issue with results
5. Next day, continues from where it left off

### Example: Daily Test Improver

The [`daily-test-improver`](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-test-improver.md) workflow systematically identifies coverage gaps and implements new tests over multiple days:

**Phase 1 (Day 1-2)**: Research coverage gaps and create plan  
**Phase 2 (Day 3-4)**: Set up test infrastructure  
**Phase 3 (Day 5+)**: Implement tests incrementally with phased approval

The key benefits are:

- Sustainable, non-disruptive improvements
- Easy to review small changes
- Builds momentum over time
- Human checkpoints between phases
- Natural task breaking

Here are our tips!

- Use repo-memory for state persistence
- Limit changes per run (1-3 items)
- Create daily PRs with descriptive titles
- Include progress reports in PR descriptions
- Allow human intervention at any phase

## Pattern 3: IssueOps - Event-Driven Issue Automation

Workflows that transform GitHub issues into automation triggers, automatically analyzing, categorizing, and responding to issues as they're created or updated. Uses safe outputs to ensure secure automated responses.

Use these when:

- Automatic issue triage
- Issue classification and labeling
- Template validation
- Initial response automation
- Related issue linking

These workflows do the following:

1. Workflow triggers on `issues: opened` or `issues: edited`
2. Agent analyzes issue content
3. Determines appropriate labels, assignees, projects
4. Uses safe outputs to apply changes
5. Optional: Posts welcome comment or requests clarification

### Example: Issue Triage Agent

The [`issue-triage-agent`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/issue-triage-agent.md) automatically labels and categorizes new issues:

- Analyzes issue title and body
- Applies relevant labels (bug, feature, documentation, etc.)
- Estimates priority based on content
- Routes to appropriate team
- Posts helpful resources

The key benefits are:

- Immediate issue processing
- Consistent categorization
- Reduces manual triage burden
- Improves issue quality over time
- Creates audit trail

Here are our tips!

- Use safe outputs for all modifications
- Include confidence scores in labels
- Allow manual override
- Track triage accuracy
- Update classification rules based on feedback
- **For public repos**: Consider if you need to [disable lockdown mode](/gh-aw/reference/faq/#what-is-github-lockdown-mode-and-when-is-it-enabled) to process issues from all users (this is one of the rare safe use cases - see [Lockdown Mode](/gh-aw/reference/lockdown-mode/) for security guidance)

## Pattern 4: LabelOps - Label-Driven Workflow Automation 🏷️

Workflows that use GitHub labels as triggers, metadata, and state markers. Responds to specific label changes with filtering to activate only for relevant labels while maintaining secure automated responses.

Use these when:

- Priority escalation
- Workflow routing
- State machine implementation
- Feature flagging
- Team assignment

These workflows do the following:

1. Workflow triggers on `issues: labeled` or `pull_request: labeled`
2. Filter checks for specific label(s)
3. Agent takes label-specific action
4. Updates state via additional labels or project fields
5. May create follow-up issues or notifications

### Example: Priority Escalation

When `priority: critical` label is added:

- Notifies team leads
- Adds to urgent project board
- Creates daily reminder
- Updates SLA tracking

The key benefits are:

- Visual state representation
- User-friendly trigger mechanism
- Easy to understand workflows

Use these when:

- Automatic project board updates
- Sprint planning assistance
- Priority management
- Status tracking
- Resource allocation

These workflows do the following:

1. Workflow triggers on issue/PR events
2. Agent analyzes content and context
3. Determines appropriate project, status, fields
4. Uses safe outputs to update project
5. Notifies relevant stakeholders

### Example: Automatic Board Population

When issue is created:

- AI determines which project(s) it belongs to
- Sets initial status (Backlog, To Do, etc.)
- Estimates size/effort
- Assigns priority
- Sets sprint/milestone if applicable

The key benefits are:

- Always up-to-date project boards
- Reduces manual project management
- Consistent field population
- AI-powered classification
- Integrates with existing workflows

Here are our tips!

## Pattern 6: TaskOps - Scaffolded Improvement Strategy 🔬

A three-phase strategy that keeps developers in control while leveraging AI agents for systematic code improvements. Provides clear decision points at each phase: Research (investigate), Plan (break down work), Assign (execute).

Use these when:

- Large refactoring initiatives
- Code quality campaigns
- Architecture improvements
- Systematic cleanup projects
- Knowledge transfer projects

These workflows do the following:

**Phase 1: Research**

- Agent analyzes codebase
- Identifies improvement opportunities
- Creates research discussion with findings
- Human reviews and approves direction

**Phase 2: Plan**

- Agent creates detailed implementation plan
- Breaks work into manageable issues
- Estimates effort and dependencies
- Human reviews and prioritizes

**Phase 3: Assign**

- Issues assigned to agents or developers
- Work proceeds incrementally
- Progress tracked via issues/PRs
- Human reviews each completion

### Example: Duplicate Code Detection

The [`duplicate-code-detector`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/duplicate-code-detector.md) uses TaskOps:

**Research**: Uses Serena MCP for semantic analysis, creates report
**Plan**: Creates well-scoped issues (max 3 per run) with refactoring strategies
**Assign**: Creates issues and [assigns to Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-a-pr#assigning-an-issue-to-copilot) (via `assignees: copilot`) since fixes are straightforward

The key benefits are:

- Human control at decision points
- Prevents runaway automation
- Clear work breakdown
- Incremental progress
- Knowledge captured in issues

Here are our tips!

- Use discussions for research phase

## Pattern 7: MultiRepoOps - Cross-Repository Coordination 🔗

Workflows that coordinate operations across multiple GitHub repositories using cross-repository safe outputs and secure authentication. Enables feature synchronization, hub-and-spoke tracking, organization-wide enforcement, and upstream/downstream workflows.

Use these when:

- Organization-wide policies
- Dependency updates across repos
- Synchronized feature rollouts
- Security compliance enforcement
- Cross-repo health monitoring

These workflows do the following:

1. Workflow runs in "hub" repository
2. Uses GitHub App or PAT for authentication
3. Queries multiple repositories
4. Analyzes cross-repo patterns
5. Uses safe outputs to create issues/PRs in target repos
6. Aggregates results back to hub

### Example: Org Health Report

The [`org-health-report`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/2c1f68a721ae7b3b67d0c2d93decf1fa5bcf7ee3/.github/workflows/org-health-report.md) analyzes health metrics across all organization repositories:

- Checks for outdated dependencies
- Validates security policies
- Monitors CI health
- Creates issues in problematic repos
- Generates org-wide report

The key benefits are:

- Organization-wide visibility
- Consistent policy enforcement
- Centralized coordination
- Reduces duplication
- Scales to many repos

Here are our tips!

- Use GitHub Apps for authentication
- Implement rate limiting
- Respect repository permissions
- Batch operations efficiently
- Monitor cross-repo dependencies

## Pattern 8: SideRepoOps - Isolated Automation Infrastructure 🏗️

Run workflows from a separate "side" repository that targets your main codebase, keeping AI-generated issues, comments, and workflow runs isolated from production code. Provides an easy way to get started with agentic workflows without cluttering your main repository.

Use these when:

- Experimenting with agents
- High-volume workflow runs
- Sensitive or noisy operations
- Testing before production
- Organizational separation

### Example: Separate Analysis Repository

Main repo: `company/product` (production code)
Side repo: `company/product-automation` (workflows)

Workflows in `product-automation` analyze `product` codebase and create issues/PRs in `product` when appropriate, but keep noisy discussions in `product-automation`.

The key benefits are:

- Keeps main repo clean
- Easy to experiment
- Clear separation of concerns
- Can be more permissive in side repo
- Easy to disable all automation

Here are our tips!

- Use GitHub Apps for cross-repo access
- Document the relationship clearly
- Consider visibility (public vs private)
- Set up appropriate notifications
- Plan for eventual migration if successful

## Pattern 9: TrialOps - Safe Workflow Validation 🧪

A specialized testing pattern that extends SideRepoOps for validating workflows in temporary trial repositories before production deployment. Creates isolated private repositories where workflows execute and capture safe outputs without affecting actual codebases.

Use these when:

- Testing new workflows
- Validating workflow changes
- Training and demonstrations
- Compliance verification
- Regression testing

These workflows do the following:

1. Create temporary private repository
2. Install workflow under test
3. Populate with test data
4. Execute workflow
5. Capture and validate outputs
6. Delete trial repo or keep for reference

## Combining Operational Patterns

Many successful agent systems combine multiple operational patterns:

- **ChatOps + IssueOps**: User triggers analysis via `/analyze`, which creates issue with results
- **DailyOps + MultiRepoOps**: Daily dependency updates across organization
- **TaskOps + ProjectOps**: Research creates project board populated with planned work
- **SideRepoOps + TrialOps**: Test in trial repo, then deploy to side repo, then main repo

## Choosing the Right Operational Pattern

When designing agent operations, consider:

1. **Trigger mechanism**: Manual (ChatOps), scheduled (DailyOps), or event-driven (IssueOps, LabelOps)?
2. **Scope**: Single repo or multi-repo (MultiRepoOps)?
3. **Isolation needs**: Production or separate (SideRepoOps, TrialOps)?
4. **Coordination**: Simple or complex (ProjectOps, TaskOps)?
5. **State management**: Stateless or stateful (LabelOps, ProjectOps)?

## What's Next?

These operational patterns work effectively because they build on a foundation of reusable, composable components. The secret weapon that enabled Peli's Agent Factory to scale wasn't just good patterns - it was the ability to share and reuse components across workflows.

In our next article, we'll explore the imports and sharing system that made this scalability possible.
