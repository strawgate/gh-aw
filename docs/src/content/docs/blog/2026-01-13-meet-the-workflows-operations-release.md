Ah! Right this way to our next chamber in [Peli's Agent Factory](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/)! The chamber where our AI agents enhance the magical moment of *shipping software*.

In our [previous post](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-13-meet-the-workflows-metrics-analytics/), we explored metrics and analytics workflows - the agents that monitor other agents, turning raw activity data into actionable insights.

## Operations & Release Workflows

The agents that help us actually ship software:

- **[Release](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.42.13/.github/workflows/release.md?plain=1)** - Orchestrates builds, tests, and release note generation
- **[Changeset](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.42.13/.github/workflows/changeset.md?plain=1)** - Manages version bumps and changelog entries for releases - **22 merged PRs out of 28 proposed (78% merge rate)**
- **[Daily Workflow Updater](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.42.13/.github/workflows/daily-workflow-updater.md?plain=1)** - Keeps GitHub Actions and dependencies current

Shipping software is stressful enough without worrying about whether you formatted your release notes correctly.

The Release workflow handles the entire orchestration - building, testing, generating coherent release notes from commits, and publishing. What's interesting here is the **reliability** requirement: these workflows can't afford to be creative or experimental. They need to be deterministic, well-tested, and boring (in a good way).

Changeset Generator has contributed **22 merged PRs out of 28 proposed (78% merge rate)**, automating version bumps and changelog generation for every release. It analyzes commits since the last release, determines the appropriate version bump (major, minor, patch), and updates the changelog accordingly.

Daily Workflow Updater keeps GitHub Actions and dependencies current, ensuring workflows don't fall behind on security patches or new features.

## Using These Workflows

You can add these workflows to your own repository and remix them. Get going with our [Quick Start](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/), then run one of the following:

**Release:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.42.13/.github/workflows/release.md
```

**Changeset:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.42.13/.github/workflows/changeset.md
```

Then edit and remix the workflow specifications to meet your needs, recompile using `gh aw compile`, and push to your repository. See our [Quick Start](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/) for further installation and setup instructions.

You can also [create your own workflows](/gh-aw/setups/creating-workflows).

## Next Up: Security-related Workflows

After all this focus on shipping, we need to talk about the guardrails: how do we ensure these powerful agents operate safely?
