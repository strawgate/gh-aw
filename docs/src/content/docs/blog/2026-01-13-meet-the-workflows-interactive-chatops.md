*Onwards, onwards!* Let's keep exploring the wonders of [Peli's Agent Factory](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/)! To the *command center* where instant magic happens!

In our [previous post](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-13-meet-the-workflows-creative-culture/), we explored creative and culture workflows - agents that bring joy, build team culture, and create moments of delight. We discovered that AI agents don't have to be all business; they can have personality while making work more enjoyable.

But sometimes you need help *right now*, at the exact moment you're stuck on a problem. You don't want to wait for a scheduled run - you want to summon an expert agent with a command. That's where interactive workflows and ChatOps come in. These agents respond to slash commands and GitHub reactions, providing on-demand assistance with full context of the current situation.

We learned that the right agent at the right moment with the right information is a valuable addition to an agent portfolio.

## Interactive & ChatOps Workflows

These agents respond to commands, providing on-demand assistance whenever you need it:

- **[Q](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/q.md?plain=1)** - Workflow optimizer that investigates performance and creates PRs - **69 merged PRs out of 88 proposed (78% merge rate)**  
- **[Grumpy Reviewer](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/grumpy-reviewer.md?plain=1)** - Performs critical code reviews with personality - creates issues for downstream agents
- **[Workflow Generator](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/workflow-generator.md?plain=1)** - Creates new workflows from issue requests - scaffolds workflow files

Interactive workflows changed how we think about agent invocation. Instead of everything running on a schedule, these respond to slash commands and reactions - `/q` summons the workflow optimizer, a 🚀 reaction triggers analysis. Q (yes, named after the James Bond quartermaster) became our go-to troubleshooter - it has contributed **69 merged PRs out of 88 proposed (78% merge rate)**, responding to commands and investigating workflow issues on demand. Recent examples include [fixing the daily-fact workflow action-tag](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/pull/14127) and [configuring PR triage reports with 1-day expiration](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/pull/13903).

The Grumpy Reviewer performs opinionated code reviews, creating issues that flag security risks and code quality concerns (e.g., [#13990](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/issues/13990) about risky event triggers) for downstream agents to fix. It gave us surprisingly valuable feedback with a side of sass ("This function is so nested it has its own ZIP code").

Workflow Generator creates new agentic workflows from issue requests, scaffolding the markdown workflow files that other agents then refine (e.g., [#13379](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/issues/13379) requesting AWF mode changes).

We learned that **context is king** - these agents work because they're invoked at the right moment with the right context, not because they run on a schedule.

## Using These Workflows

You can add these workflows to your own repository and remix them. Get going with our [Quick Start](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/), then run one of the following:

**Q:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/q.md
```

**Grumpy Reviewer:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/grumpy-reviewer.md
```

**Workflow Generator:**

```bash
gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/v0.45.5/.github/workflows/workflow-generator.md
```

Then edit and remix the workflow specifications to meet your needs, regenerate the lock file using `gh aw compile`, and push to your repository. See our [Quick Start](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/) for further installation and setup instructions.

You can also [create your own workflows](/gh-aw/setup/creating-workflows).

## Next Up: Testing & Validation Workflows

While ChatOps agents respond to commands, we also need workflows that continuously verify our systems still function as expected.
