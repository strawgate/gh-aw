You can author new agentic workflows using AI, under your guidance.

In this guide, we show you how to create agentic workflows in the GitHub web interface (github.com), your coding agent, or in VS Code chat.

## Creating Agentic Workflows using VSCode or a Coding Agent

Follow these steps to create an agentic workflow using VSCode or your coding agent.

1. **Start your coding agent**.

   Choose your preferred coding agent and start it in the context of your repository. For example, you can:
   - Start [VSCode Agent Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/agents/overview)
   - Start your CLI coding agent in your repository
   - Go to the "Agents" tab for your repository on https://github.com

2. **Create an agentic workflow**.

   Enter the following prompt into your coding agent:

   ```text wrap
   Create a workflow for GitHub Agentic Workflows using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/create.md

   The purpose of the workflow is to triage issues.
   ```

   You can replace the last line with your desired workflow purpose and as much additional detail, context, goals, guardrails and purpose as you like.

3. **Setup required secrets**.

   If you haven't done so already, [set up your repository secrets](/gh-aw/reference/engines/) for the coding agent your workflow will be using (Copilot, Claude, Codex). Also need to adjust the `engine:` setting in your generated workflow to match if not using Copilot CLI.

Optionally you can also add the [Custom Agent for Agentic Workflows](/gh-aw/reference/custom-agent/) to your repository by entering this into your coding agent:

```text wrap
Initialize this repository for GitHub Agentic Workflows using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install.md
```

## Creating Agentic Workflows with ChatGPT

If you prefer to use ChatGPT to author agentic workflow, you can use the [agentic-chat instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/skills/agentic-chat/SKILL.md) with ChatGPT or other conversational AI applications to create clear, actionable task descriptions. Use the button below to copy the full instructions: <CopyEntireFileButton filePath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/skills/agentic-chat/SKILL.md" label="Copy agentic-chat instructions" />.

The agentic-chat assistant helps you:
- Break down complex problems into clear, actionable phases
- Structure task descriptions for AI coding agents
- Write specifications without implementation details
- Follow best practices for agentic workflow task descriptions

To use the agentic-chat instructions:

1. Copy the full instructions using the button above
2. Paste them into your ChatGPT or other AI chat interface
3. Describe your workflow goal or problem
4. The assistant will ask clarifying questions and generate a structured task description
5. Copy the generated task description (wrapped in 5 backticks) and use it in your workflow

The assistant uses a neutral, technical tone and focuses on what needs to be done rather than how to implement it, making it ideal for creating specifications that AI coding agents can execute.

## Dictating Agentic Workflows

When creating agentic workflows using speech-to-text (dictation), you may encounter terminology mismatches and formatting issues common to voice recognition systems. To help correct these issues, use the [dictation instructions prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/skills/dictation/SKILL.md) or <CopyEntireFileButton filePath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/skills/dictation/SKILL.md" label="Copy full instructions" />.

This prompt helps rephrase text captured through speech-to-text recognition by:
- Correcting project-specific terminology (e.g., "ghaw" → "gh-aw", "work flow" → "workflow")
- Transforming casual dictated sentences into clear, imperative task descriptions
- Removing filler words and improving technical tone
- Adding necessary context that might be implicit in spoken requests

Load the dictation prompt into your AI assistant before or after dictating your workflow instructions to improve accuracy and clarity.

### Migrating Workflows Between Repositories

When you need to adapt an existing workflow from another repository, use the `create-agentic-agent` to perform AI-assisted migration. The agent analyzes the source workflow, identifies dependencies, adapts configuration for your repository, and validates the result. This is useful for forking workflows as starting points or one-time migrations requiring substantial changes. For synchronized updates across repositories, use [Packaging & Distribution](/gh-aw/guides/packaging-imports/) with `gh aw add` instead.

Example prompt for migration:
```text wrap
Migrate the release.md workflow from github/gh-aw to this repository.
Adapt permissions and repository-specific references for our structure.
```

### Remixing Existing Workflows

You can also remix existing workflows from other repositories by prompting your coding agent to modify or enhance them. For example, you might want to add new features, improve efficiency, or adjust to new requirements. Use prompts like:

```text wrap
Create a workflow for GitHub Agentic Workflows using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/create.md

Remix the issue-triage.md workflow from github/gh-aw to add automatic labeling based on issue content and priority.
```
