You can author new agentic workflows using a coding agent or other AI chat system, under your guidance. For interactive coding agents, this can be a conversation about what you want the workflow to do, with the agent asking clarifying questions and generating the workflow for you.

In this guide, we show you how to create agentic workflows in the GitHub web interface (github.com), your coding agent, or in VS Code Agent Mode.

## Creating Agentic Workflows using a Coding Agent

Follow these steps to create an agentic workflow using VSCode or your coding agent.

1. **Start your coding agent**.

   Choose your preferred coding agent and start it in the context of your repository. For example, you can:
   - Start [VSCode Agent Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/agents/overview)
   - Start your CLI coding agent in your repository
   - Go to the "Agents" tab for your repository on https://github.com

2. **Create an agentic workflow**.

   Enter the following prompt into your coding agent:

   ```text wrap
   Create a workflow for GitHub Agentic Workflows using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/create.md

   The purpose of the workflow is a daily report on recent activity in the repository, delivered as an issue.
   ```

   You can replace the last line with your desired workflow purpose and as much additional detail, context, goals, guardrails and purpose as you like.

   This will create a new [workflow markdown file](/gh-aw/reference/workflow-structure/) in `.github/workflows/` with the appropriate configuration. Some agents will create a pull request to add these changes to your repository.

3. **Setup required secrets**.

   If you haven't done so already, [set up your repository secrets](/gh-aw/reference/engines/) for your chosen engine (Copilot, Claude, or Codex). If not using Copilot, also adjust the `engine:` field in your workflow's [frontmatter](/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/).

After merging the pull request, you can run the workflow to see it in action. Either:
- trigger runs manually from the Actions tab in GitHub.com, or
- use [the `gh aw run` command](/gh-aw/setup/cli/#run) to trigger runs from your terminal.

## Creating Agentic Workflows with an AI Chatbot

If you prefer to use an AI chatbot to author agentic workflow, you can use the [agentic-chat instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/.github/aw/agentic-chat.md) with any conversational AI application to create clear, actionable task descriptions. Use the button below to copy the full instructions: <CopyEntireFileButton filePath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/.github/aw/agentic-chat.md" label="Copy agentic-chat instructions" />.

The agentic-chat assistant helps you:
- Break down complex problems into clear, actionable phases
- Structure task descriptions for AI coding agents
- Write specifications without implementation details
- Follow best practices for agentic workflow task descriptions

To use the agentic-chat instructions:

1. Copy the full instructions using the button above
2. Paste them into your AI chat interface
3. Describe your workflow goal or problem
4. The assistant will ask clarifying questions and generate a structured task description
5. Copy the generated task description (wrapped in 5 backticks) and use it in your workflow

The assistant uses a neutral, technical tone and focuses on what needs to be done rather than how to implement it, making it ideal for creating specifications that AI coding agents can execute.

## Dictating Agentic Workflows

When creating agentic workflows using speech-to-text (dictation), you may encounter terminology mismatches and formatting issues common to voice recognition systems. To help correct these issues, use the [dictation instructions prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/skills/dictation/SKILL.md) or <CopyEntireFileButton filePath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/skills/dictation/SKILL.md" label="Copy full instructions" />.

This prompt helps rephrase text captured through speech-to-text recognition by:
- Correcting project-specific terminology (e.g., "ghaw" → "gh-aw", "work flow" → "workflow")
- Transforming casual dictated sentences into clear, imperative task descriptions
- Removing filler words and improving technical tone
- Adding necessary context that might be implicit in spoken requests

Load the dictation prompt into your AI assistant before or after dictating your workflow instructions to improve accuracy and clarity.

### Migrating Workflows Between Repositories

When you need to adapt an existing workflow from another repository, use the `create-agentic-agent` to perform AI-assisted migration. The agent analyzes the source workflow, identifies dependencies, adapts configuration for your repository, and validates the result. This is useful for forking workflows as starting points or one-time migrations requiring substantial changes. For synchronized updates across repositories, use [Packaging & Distribution](/gh-aw/guides/packaging-imports/) with `gh aw add` instead.

Example prompt for migration:
```text wrap
Migrate the release.md workflow from github/gh-aw to this repository.
Adapt permissions and repository-specific references for our structure.
```

### Remixing Existing Workflows

You can also remix existing workflows from other repositories by prompting your coding agent to modify or enhance them. For example, you might want to add new features, improve efficiency, or adjust to new requirements. Use prompts like:

```text wrap
Create a workflow for GitHub Agentic Workflows using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/create.md

Remix the issue-triage.md workflow from github/gh-aw to add automatic labeling based on issue content and priority.
```

## Creating Agentic Workflows manually

If you prefer to create workflows manually, you can

1. Create the workflow file in `.github/workflows/<workflow-name>.md`
2. Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) and the GitHub Agentic Workflows extension:

   ```bash wrap
   gh extension install github/gh-aw
   ```

3. Compile the workflow markdown into a YAML workflow file using:

   ```bash wrap
   gh aw compile
   ```

   This will generate a workflow YAML lock file `.github/workflows/<workflow-name>.lock.yml` based on the content of your markdown file.

4. Add, commit and push the workflow file and its lock file to your repository.

   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/<workflow-name>.md
   git add .github/workflows/<workflow-name>.lock.yml
   git commit -m "Add <workflow-name> workflow"
   git push
   ```

5. If you haven't done so already, [set up your repository secrets](/gh-aw/reference/engines/) for the coding agent your workflow will be using.

You can now trigger runs of the workflow either from the Actions tab in GitHub.com or using the `gh aw run` command from your terminal.

## Adding an existing Agentic Workflow

You can add any existing workflow you have access to.

1. Find the workflow you want to add on github.com. This could be in another repository.

   Check carefully the workflow comes from a trusted source and is appropriate for your use in your repository. Review the workflow's content and understand what it does before adding it to your repository.

2. Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) and the GitHub Agentic Workflows extension:

   ```bash wrap
   gh extension install github/gh-aw
   ```

3. Use the `gh aw add` command to add the workflow to your repository:

   ```bash wrap
   gh aw add-wizard <workflow-url>
   ```

   For example, to add the daily-repo-status workflow from the top-level `workflows` directory of the `github/agentics` repository, you would run:

   ```bash wrap
   gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-repo-status.md
   ```

   This will work for any URL to a workflow markdown file on GitHub.
   
   If the workflow is in the top-level `workflows` directory, you can use a shorter form:

   ```bash wrap
   gh aw add-wizard githubnext/agentics/daily-repo-status
   ```

   Either way this will check various requirements and add the workflow markdown file to your repository and generate the corresponding YAML workflow.

4. Commit and push the changes to your repository.

You can now trigger runs of the workflow either from the Actions tab in GitHub.com or using the `gh aw run` command from your terminal.

## Adding Further Supporting Files for Agentic Workflows

Optionally, you can also add additional developer support for agentic workflows:

```text wrap
Initialize this repository for GitHub Agentic Workflows using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install.md
```

This will
1. Install the gh-aw CLI extension
2. Add settings and prompts for VSCode, Copilot and general workflow management
3. Commit the changes and make a pull request

Alternatively you can run `gh aw init` from your terminal after installing the `gh-aw` extension.
