**⏱️ Estimated time: 5-15 minutes** depending on complexity

You can author new agentic workflows using a coding agent or other AI chat system, under your guidance. For interactive coding agents, this can be a conversation about what you want the workflow to do, with the agent asking clarifying questions and generating the workflow for you.

In this guide, we show you how to create agentic workflows in the GitHub web interface (github.com), your coding agent, or in VS Code Agent Mode.


## GitHub Web Interface

**If you have access to GitHub Copilot**, you can create and edit Agentic Workflows directly 
from the Web Interface. This technique is slow and non-interactive 
but it is incredibly useful to turn an idea to reality in a couple minutes. 
For a more fine grained, interactive experience we recommend using a coding agent (see next section).

Use this Agent Session task in your repository.

```markdown wrap
Create a workflow for GitHub Agentic Workflows using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/create.md

The purpose of the workflow is triage issues.
```

> [!TIP]
> On the first run in a new repository, the workflow will surely fail because the secrets are not configured.
> The agentic workflow should detect the missing tokens and create an issue with instructions on how to configure them.

## VSCode/Claude/Codex/Copilot

Follow these steps to create an agentic workflow using VSCode or your coding CLI agent.

1. **Start your coding agent**.

   Choose your preferred coding agent and start it in the context of your repository. For example, you can:
   - Start [VSCode Agent Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/agents/overview)
   - Start your CLI coding agent in your repository

2. **Create an agentic workflow**.

   Enter the following prompt into your coding agent:

   ```text wrap
   Create a workflow for GitHub Agentic Workflows using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/create.md

   The purpose of the workflow is a daily report on recent activity in the repository, delivered as an issue.
   ```

   You can replace the last line with your desired workflow purpose and as much additional detail, context, goals, guardrails and purpose as you like.

   This will create a new [workflow markdown file](/gh-aw/reference/workflow-structure/) in `.github/workflows/` with the appropriate configuration. Some agents will create a pull request to add these changes to your repository.

3. **Setup required secrets**.

   If you haven't done so already, [set up your repository secrets](/gh-aw/reference/engines/) for your chosen engine (Copilot, Claude, or Codex). If not using Copilot, also adjust the `engine:` field in your workflow's [frontmatter](/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/).

After merging the pull request, you can run the workflow to see it in action. Either:
- trigger runs manually from the Actions tab in GitHub.com, or
- use [the `gh aw run` command](/gh-aw/setup/cli/#run) to trigger runs from your terminal.

> [!TIP]
> If you plan to keep using this way of editing workflows, run our `init` command to configure your repository
> to make the agent more effective.
> ```bash wrap
> gh aw init
> ```
> or run this prompt
> ```text wrap
> Initialize this repository for GitHub Agentic Workflows using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install.md
> ```

## Manual Editing

If you prefer to create workflows manually, you can

1. Create the workflow file in `.github/workflows/<workflow-name>.md`
2. Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) and the GitHub Agentic Workflows extension:

   ```bash wrap
   gh extension install github/gh-aw
   ```

3. Compile the workflow markdown into a YAML workflow file using:

   ```bash wrap
   gh aw compile
   ```

   This will generate a workflow YAML lock file `.github/workflows/<workflow-name>.lock.yml` based on the content of your markdown file.

4. Add, commit and push the workflow file and its lock file to your repository.

   ```bash wrap
   git add .github/workflows/<workflow-name>.md
   git add .github/workflows/<workflow-name>.lock.yml
   git commit -m "Add <workflow-name> workflow"
   git push
   ```

5. If you haven't done so already, [set up your repository secrets](/gh-aw/reference/engines/) for the coding agent your workflow will be using.

You can now trigger runs of the workflow either from the Actions tab in GitHub.com or using the `gh aw run` command from your terminal.
