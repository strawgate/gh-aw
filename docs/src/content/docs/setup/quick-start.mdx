**Agentic workflows** are AI-powered repository automation running in GitHub Actions - you write instructions in markdown, the AI does the work. Unlike regular Actions with fixed rules, agents understand context, make decisions and adapt to situations. [Learn more →](/gh-aw/introduction/overview/)

**⏱️ Estimated time: 10 minutes**

## Adding an Automated Daily Status Workflow to Your Repo

In this guide you will add an existing, pre-backed workflow to an existing GitHub repository where you are a maintainer - the automated [**Daily Repo Status Report**](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-repo-status.md?plain=1), running in GitHub Actions.

The aim here is to become familiar with **automated AI**: to install something that will run **automatically**, **recurringly**, in the context of your repository. In this case the workflow will run daily, though you can also invoke it manually. Every day, the workflow will create or update a fresh status report issue in your repository, without any further manual intervention. If you're familiar with GitHub Actions, you will be aware of the power of automation in repositories; this is simply taking that to the next level with AI.

Alternatively:
- To add a custom workflow of your own design, see [Creating Agentic Workflows](/gh-aw/setup/creating-workflows/).
- You can find more examples of pre-baked workflows in [Peli's Agent Factory](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/).

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have:

- **AI Account** - [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) subscription (recommended), or an [Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/) or [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/api/) API key. See [Engines](/gh-aw/reference/engines/) for setup details.
- **GitHub Repository** - A repository where you have **Write** access or higher
- **GitHub Actions** enabled - [Check in Settings → Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository)
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) v2.0.0+ - [Install here](https://cli.github.com). Check version: `gh --version`
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL

### Step 1 - Install the extension

Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), then install the GitHub Agentic Workflows extension:

```bash wrap
gh extension install github/gh-aw
```

If you are encountering authentication issues, use this script instead:

```bash wrap
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | bash
```

### Step 2 - Add the sample workflow and trigger a run

From your repository root run:

```bash wrap
gh aw add-wizard githubnext/agentics/daily-repo-status
```

This will take you through an interactive process to:

1. **Check pre-requisttes** - Verify you have the necessary permissions, GitHub Actions enabled, and other requirements of the workflow
2. **Select an AI Engine** - Choose between Claude, Copilot, or Codex
3. **Set up required secrets** - Prompts for API keys if needed (stored as [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions))
4. **Add the workflow** - Copies the workflow [markdown file](/gh-aw/reference/workflow-structure/) to `.github/workflows/`
5. **Trigger an initial run** - Starts the workflow immediately

> [!TIP]
> **Having trouble?** Check [Setting up repository secrets](/gh-aw/reference/engines/) and ask for help in [Community Feedback](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/186451).

An automated workflow run can take 2-3 minutes.

Once your initial run is complete, a new issue will be created in your repository with a "repo status report". The report will be automatically generated by the AI based on recent activity in your repository, including issues, PRs, discussions, releases, and code changes. It will analyze:

- Recent repository activity (issues, PRs, discussions, releases, code changes)
- Progress tracking, goal reminders and highlights
- Project status and recommendations
- Actionable next steps for maintainers

### Going further - Customize your workflow

Your automated agent is fully customizable. If you like, you can customize it now:

1. Edit the workflow markdown file located at `.github/workflows/daily-repo-status.md` in your repository.

2. Regenerate the workflow YAML by running:

   ```bash
   gh aw compile
   ```

3. Commit and push to your repository.

4. You can now optionally trigger another run by running:

   ```bash
   gh aw run daily-repo-status
   ```

Some ideas for customization:

- Adjust the schedule to run more or less frequently
- Modify the style or content of the report
- Adjust the instructions to analyze patterns in failed CI runs or test coverage
- Request analysis of compliance with organizational standards
- Request analysis of ways the repository could be modernized or simplified
