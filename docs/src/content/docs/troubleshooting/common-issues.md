This reference documents frequently encountered issues when working with GitHub Agentic Workflows, organized by workflow stage and component.

## Installation Issues

### Extension Installation Fails

If `gh extension install github/gh-aw` fails with authentication or permission errors, use the standalone installer:

```bash wrap
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | bash
```

The installer works in restricted networks (Codespaces, MITM proxies) and installs to `~/.local/share/gh/extensions/gh-aw/gh-aw`.

### Install Specific Version

Install specific versions by passing the version tag as an argument. Find available versions at the [releases page](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/releases).

```bash wrap
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | bash -s -- v0.40.0
```

### Extension Not Found After Installation

Verify installation with `gh extension list`. If not listed, reinstall with `gh extension install github/gh-aw` or use the standalone installer.

### Codespace Authentication Issues

GitHub Codespaces may have limited permissions for installing extensions. Try the standalone installer (recommended) or grant additional permissions to your Codespace token.

## Organization Policy Issues

### Custom Actions Not Allowed in Enterprise Organizations

**Error Message:**

```text
The action github/gh-aw/actions/setup@a933c835b5e2d12ae4dead665a0fdba420a2d421 is not allowed in {ORG} because all actions must be from a repository owned by your enterprise, created by GitHub, or verified in the GitHub Marketplace.
```

**Cause:** Enterprise policies restrict which GitHub Actions can be used. Workflows use `github/gh-aw/actions/setup` which may not be allowed.

**Solution:** Enterprise administrators must allow `github/gh-aw` in the organization's action policies:

#### Option 1: Allow Specific Repositories (Recommended)

Add `github/gh-aw` to your organization's allowed actions list:

1. Navigate to your organization's settings: `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG/settings/actions`
2. Under **Policies**, select **Allow select actions and reusable workflows**
3. In the **Allow specified actions and reusable workflows** section, add:
   ```text
   github/gh-aw@*
   ```
4. Save the changes

See GitHub's docs on [managing Actions permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#allowing-select-actions-and-reusable-workflows-to-run).

#### Option 2: Configure Organization-Wide Policy File

Add `github/gh-aw@*` to your centralized `policies/actions.yml` and commit to your organization's `.github` repository. See GitHub's docs on [community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

```yaml
allowed_actions:
  - "actions/*"
  - "github/gh-aw@*"
```

#### Verification

Wait a few minutes for policy propagation, then re-run your workflow. If issues persist, verify at `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG/settings/actions`.

> [!TIP]
> The gh-aw actions are open source at [github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/main/actions](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/main/actions) and pinned to specific SHAs for security.

## Repository Configuration Issues

### Actions Restrictions Reported During Init

The CLI validates three permission layers when running `gh aw init` or `gh aw add-wizard`:

**Actions disabled:** Enable in Repository Settings → Actions → General. [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository).

**Local-only restriction:** Switch to "Allow all actions" or "Allow select actions" with GitHub-created actions enabled. Workflows need `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, etc. [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#managing-github-actions-permissions-for-your-repository).

**Selective allowlist:** Enable "Allow actions created by GitHub" checkbox in Settings → Actions → General. [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#allowing-select-actions-and-reusable-workflows-to-run).

> [!NOTE]
> Organization-level policies override repository settings. Request changes from org admins if settings are grayed out.

## Workflow Compilation Issues

### Workflow Won't Compile

If `gh aw compile` fails, check YAML frontmatter syntax (proper indentation with spaces, colons with spaces after them), verify required fields like `on:` are present, and ensure field types match the schema. Use `gh aw compile --verbose` for detailed error messages.

### Lock File Not Generated

If `.lock.yml` isn't created, fix compilation errors first (`gh aw compile 2>&1 | grep -i error`) and verify write permissions on `.github/workflows/`.

### Orphaned Lock Files

Remove old `.lock.yml` files after deleting `.md` files with `gh aw compile --purge`.

## Import and Include Issues

### Import File Not Found

Import paths are relative to repository root. Verify the file exists with `git status`. Examples: `.github/workflows/shared/tools.md` or `shared/security-notice.md`.

### Multiple Agent Files Error

Import only one `.github/agents/` file per workflow. Use other imports for shared content.

### Circular Import Dependencies

If compilation hangs, check for circular import references and remove them.

## Tool Configuration Issues

### GitHub Tools Not Available

Configure GitHub tools using `toolsets:` (recommended) or verify tool names from the [tools reference](/gh-aw/reference/tools/):

```yaml wrap
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [repos, issues]  # Recommended: use toolsets
```

### Toolset Missing Expected Tools

Check [toolset contents](/gh-aw/reference/tools/#toolset-contents) to find your tool, combine toolsets as needed (e.g., `toolsets: [default, actions]`), or run `gh aw mcp inspect <workflow>` to see available tools.

### MCP Server Connection Failures

Verify package installation, configuration syntax, and required environment variables:

```yaml
mcp-servers:
  my-server:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["@myorg/mcp-server"]
    env:
      API_KEY: "${{ secrets.MCP_API_KEY }}"
```

### Playwright Network Access Denied

Add blocked domains to the `allowed_domains` list:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  playwright:
    allowed_domains: ["github.com", "*.github.io"]
```

### Cannot Find Module 'playwright'

**Error Message:**

```text
Error: Cannot find module 'playwright'
Require stack:
- /tmp/gh-aw/agent/script.js
```

**Cause:** The AI agent tried to use `require('playwright')` or created a standalone Node.js script expecting the playwright npm package to be installed. In gh-aw workflows, Playwright is provided through an MCP server interface, not as an npm package.

**Solution:** Use Playwright through MCP tools instead of trying to require the module:

```javascript
// ❌ INCORRECT - This won't work
const playwright = require('playwright');
const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch();

// ✅ CORRECT - Use MCP Playwright tools
// Example: Navigate and take screenshot
await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({
  url: "https://example.com"
});

await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();

// Example: Execute custom Playwright code
await mcp__playwright__browser_run_code({
  code: `async (page) => {
    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 390, height: 844 });
    const title = await page.title();
    return { title, url: page.url() };
  }`
});
```

**Available MCP Playwright Tools:**
- `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` - Navigate to URL
- `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` - Take screenshot
- `mcp__playwright__browser_run_code` - Execute custom Playwright code
- `mcp__playwright__browser_click` - Click elements
- `mcp__playwright__browser_type` - Type text
- `mcp__playwright__browser_close` - Close browser

See the [Playwright Tool documentation](/gh-aw/reference/tools/#playwright-tool-playwright) for complete details.

## Permission Issues

### Write Operations Fail

Use safe outputs, or ask for new safe output types if needed.

### Safe Outputs Not Creating Issues

Disable staged mode to create issues (not just preview):

```yaml wrap
safe-outputs:
  staged: false
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[bot] "
    labels: [automation]
```

### Token Permission Errors

Add permissions to `GITHUB_TOKEN` or use a custom token:

```yaml wrap
# Increase GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write

# Or use custom token
safe-outputs:
  github-token: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_PAT }}
  create-issue:
```

### Project Field Type Errors

**Problem**: GitHub Projects reserves field types like `REPOSITORY` that cannot be updated via API.

**Solution**: Use alternative field names (`repo`, `source_repository`, `linked_repo`) instead of `repository`:

```yaml wrap
# ❌ Wrong
safe-outputs:
  update-project:
    fields:
      repository: "myorg/myrepo"

# ✅ Correct
safe-outputs:
  update-project:
    fields:
      repo: "myorg/myrepo"
```

Delete conflicting fields in GitHub Projects UI and recreate with different names.

## Engine-Specific Issues

### Copilot CLI Not Found

Verify compilation succeeded. The compiled workflow should include CLI installation steps.

### Model Not Available

Use the default model (`engine: copilot`) or specify an available one (`engine: {id: copilot, model: gpt-4}`).

## Context Expression Issues

### Unauthorized Expression

Use only [allowed expressions](/gh-aw/reference/templating/) like `github.event.issue.number`, `github.repository`, or `needs.activation.outputs.text`. Expressions like `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` or `env.MY_VAR` are not allowed.

### Sanitized Context Empty

`needs.activation.outputs.text` is only populated for issue, PR, or comment events (e.g., `on: issues:`) but not for other triggers like `push:`.

## Build and Test Issues

### Documentation Build Fails

Install dependencies, check for malformed frontmatter or MDX syntax, and fix broken links:

```bash wrap
cd docs
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Tests Failing After Changes

Format code and check for issues before running tests:

```bash wrap
make fmt
make lint
make test-unit
```

## Network and Connectivity Issues

### Firewall Denials for Package Registries

Add ecosystem identifiers to allow package installations:

```yaml wrap
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults    # Basic infrastructure
    - python      # PyPI, pip
    - node        # npm, yarn, pnpm
    - containers  # Docker Hub, GHCR
    - go          # Go modules
```

See [Network Configuration Guide](/gh-aw/guides/network-configuration/) for details.

### URLs Appearing as "(redacted)"

URLs are filtered when domains aren't in the allowed list. Add domains to your `network:` configuration:

```yaml wrap
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults
    - "api.example.com"
```

See [Network Permissions](/gh-aw/reference/network/) for details.

### Cannot Download Remote Imports

Verify network access with `curl -I https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/README.md` and GitHub authentication with `gh auth status`.

### MCP Server Connection Timeout

Use local MCP servers if HTTP connections timeout (`command: "node"`, `args: ["./server.js"]`).

## Cache Issues

### Cache Not Restoring

Verify cache key patterns match. Caches expire after 7 days.

```yaml wrap
cache:
  key: deps-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
  restore-keys: deps-
```

### Cache Memory Not Persisting

Configure cache for the memory MCP server:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  cache-memory:
    key: memory-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.run_id }}
```

## GitHub Lockdown Mode Blocking Expected Content

**GitHub lockdown mode** filters public repository content to only show items from users with push access. This protects workflows from untrusted input but can block legitimate use cases.

### Symptoms

- Workflow cannot see newly created issues or pull requests
- Comments from external contributors are invisible
- Status reports missing recent activity
- Triage workflows not processing community contributions

### Cause

GitHub lockdown mode is automatically enabled by default for public repositories. The workflow only sees content from users with push, maintain, or admin access.

This means that, by default, your workflow will not see issues, PRs, or comments from external contributors in a public repository. This is a security measure to prevent untrusted input from influencing the workflow, but it can interfere with workflows that need to process community contributions.

### Solution

Evaluate if your workflow needs to process content from all users:

**Option 1: Keep Lockdown Enabled (Recommended for most workflows)**

If your workflow performs sensitive operations (code generation, repository updates, web access), keep lockdown enabled. Consider alternative approaches:

- Use separate workflows: One with lockdown for sensitive operations, another without for public processing
- Manual triggers: Let maintainers trigger workflows after reviewing external content
- Approval workflows: Create a two-stage workflow where maintainers approve content before processing

**Option 2: Disable Lockdown (For Safe Public Workflows)**

If your workflow is **specifically designed** to handle untrusted input safely, disable lockdown:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  github:
    lockdown: false
```

**Only use `lockdown: false` if your workflow**:

- Uses restrictive safe outputs with specific allowed values
- Doesn't generate code or create pull requests
- Validates/sanitizes all input before processing
- Does not access secrets or perform sensitive operations

**Safe use cases**: Issue triage/labeling, spam detection, public dashboards, command workflows that verify permissions.

See [Lockdown Mode](/gh-aw/reference/lockdown-mode/) for complete configuration guidance and security considerations.

## Workflow Failures and Debugging

### Why Did My Workflow Fail?

Common causes: missing tokens (`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`), permission mismatches (`permissions:`), network restrictions (`network.allowed`), disabled tools (`tools:`), or AI API rate limits. Use `gh aw audit <run-id>` to investigate.

### How Do I Debug a Failing Workflow?

Check workflow logs (`gh aw logs`), audit the run (`gh aw audit <run-id>`), inspect `.lock.yml`, use Copilot Chat (`/agent agentic-workflows debug`), or watch compilation (`gh aw compile --watch`).

### Debugging Strategies

Enable verbose compilation (`--verbose`), set `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG = true`, inspect lock files, check MCP config (`gh aw mcp inspect`), and review logs.

## Operational Runbooks

See [Workflow Health Monitoring Runbook](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/aw/runbooks/workflow-health.md) for diagnosing missing-tool errors, authentication failures, and configuration issues.

## Getting Help

Review [reference docs](/gh-aw/reference/workflow-structure/), search [existing issues](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/issues), enable verbose flags, or create an issue. See [Error Reference](/gh-aw/troubleshooting/errors/) and [Frontmatter Reference](/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/).
