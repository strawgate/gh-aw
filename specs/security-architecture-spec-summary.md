# Security Architecture Specification - Summary

**Document**: `security-architecture-spec.md`  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Status**: Candidate Recommendation  
**Date**: January 29, 2026

## Overview

The GitHub Agentic Workflows Security Architecture Specification is a formal W3C-style document that defines the security architecture, guarantees, and implementation requirements for gh-aw. This specification enables organizations to replicate the security model in other CI/CD environments.

## Key Highlights

### Conformance Classes

1. **Basic Conformance** (Level 1): Core security controls
   - Input sanitization
   - Output isolation
   - Permission management
   - Compilation-time checks

2. **Standard Conformance** (Level 2): Production-ready security
   - Basic + Network isolation
   - Basic + Sandbox isolation
   - Basic + Runtime enforcement

3. **Complete Conformance** (Level 3): Maximum security
   - Standard + Threat detection
   - Standard + All recommended enhancements

### Security Architecture Layers

The specification defines a **7-layer defense-in-depth architecture**:

0. **Compilation-Time Validation** - Schema, expressions, permissions
1. **Input Sanitization Layer** - @mentions, bot triggers, XML/HTML, URIs
2. **Output Isolation Layer** - Separate read/write operations
3. **Network Isolation Layer** - Domain allowlisting, ecosystem IDs
4. **Permission Management Layer** - Least privilege, role-based access
5. **Sandbox Isolation Layer** - AWF/SRT containers, MCP isolation
6. **Threat Detection Layer** - Prompt injection, secret leaks, malicious patches

### Core Security Guarantees

The specification defines **7 security guarantees (SG-01 to SG-07)**:

- **SG-01**: Untrusted input not directly interpolated into GitHub Actions expressions without sanitization
- **SG-02**: AI agents have no direct write access
- **SG-03**: Network access restricted to allowlists
- **SG-04**: Least-privilege permissions by default
- **SG-05**: Agent processes in isolated sandboxes
- **SG-06**: All actions produce auditable artifacts
- **SG-07**: Security failures prevent execution (fail-secure)

**Note on SG-01**: This guarantee protects against template injection in GitHub Actions expressions. It does not prevent AI agents from accessing untrusted data at runtime through tools like GitHub MCP (which can return issue titles, PR bodies, etc.). Such data is subject to AI prompt injection risks, which are addressed through threat detection (Layer 6) and safe outputs isolation (Layer 2).

### Formal Requirements

- **130+ formal requirements** using RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHALL, SHOULD, MAY)
- **70+ compliance tests** across 8 categories
- **8 comprehensive appendices** with diagrams, examples, and best practices

### Test Categories

1. **Input Sanitization Tests** (T-IS-001 to T-IS-008)
2. **Output Isolation Tests** (T-OI-001 to T-OI-007)
3. **Network Isolation Tests** (T-NI-001 to T-NI-009)
4. **Permission Management Tests** (T-PM-001 to T-PM-007)
5. **Sandbox Isolation Tests** (T-SI-001 to T-SI-007)
6. **Threat Detection Tests** (T-TD-001 to T-TD-007)
7. **Compilation-Time Security Tests** (T-CS-001 to T-CS-006)
8. **Runtime Security Tests** (T-RS-001 to T-RS-008)

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Security Architecture Diagram
Complete visual representation of the security architecture with all layers, plus a concrete job dependency graph showing `pre_activation → activation → agent → detection → safe_outputs → conclusion`.

### Appendix B: Sanitization Examples
Real-world examples of @mention, bot trigger, XML/HTML, and URI sanitization.

### Appendix C: Network Configuration Examples
Sample configurations for default, selective, protocol-specific, and blocked domains.

### Appendix D: Safe Output Configuration Examples
Examples of basic, multi-output, and threat-detection-enabled configurations.

### Appendix E: Concurrency Control Examples
Examples of concurrency configuration patterns for PR workflows, issue workflows, scheduled workflows, and repository-wide locks.

### Appendix F: Strict Mode Violations
Common violations and error messages for write permissions, unpinned actions, and wildcards.

### Appendix G: Lock File Validation Checklist
Step-by-step checklist for verifying that a compiled `.lock.yml` file meets all security requirements, covering action pinning, permission separation, fork protection, input sanitization, threat detection, role-based access control, AWF sandbox, concurrency control, and runtime validation.

### Appendix H: Security Best Practices
Six key best practices with "Don't" and "Do" examples.

## Target Audience

- **Security Engineers**: Audit and verify security controls
- **Platform Engineers**: Implement equivalent systems in other CI/CD platforms
