# GitHub Agentic Workflows Security Architecture Specification

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Status**: Candidate Recommendation  
**Latest Version**: https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/specs/security-architecture-spec.md  
**Editors**: GitHub Next (GitHub, Inc.)

---

## Abstract

This specification defines the security architecture, guarantees, and implementation requirements for GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw), a system for compiling natural language workflow definitions into secure, sandboxed GitHub Actions workflows. The specification establishes formal conformance requirements for implementations seeking to replicate this security model in other CI/CD environments.

The security architecture employs defense-in-depth principles including input sanitization, output isolation, network segmentation, permission minimization, and threat detection. All security controls are implemented at compilation time and enforced at runtime through generated GitHub Actions workflows.

## Status of This Document

This is a Candidate Recommendation specification and represents the current state of the GitHub Agentic Workflows security architecture as implemented in version 1.0.0. This specification is subject to updates based on security research, community feedback, and operational experience. Future versions may introduce additional security controls or refine existing requirements.

**Publication Date**: January 29, 2026  
**Governance**: This specification is maintained by GitHub Next and governed by GitHub's security and research processes.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This specification formalizes the security architecture implemented in GitHub Agentic Workflows, enabling:

1. **Replication**: Organizations can implement equivalent security controls in other CI/CD platforms
2. **Verification**: Security teams can audit implementations against formal requirements
3. **Compliance**: Systems can demonstrate conformance to defined security standards
4. **Evolution**: The specification provides a foundation for future security enhancements

### 1.2 Scope

This specification covers:

- Multi-layered security architecture and defense-in-depth strategies
- Input sanitization mechanisms for untrusted content
- Output isolation patterns separating read from write operations
- Network segmentation and domain allowlisting
- Permission management and least-privilege enforcement
- Sandbox isolation for agent processes and MCP servers
- Threat detection and validation procedures
- Compilation-time security validation
- Runtime security enforcement mechanisms

This specification does NOT cover:

- AI model security or prompt engineering best practices
- Application-level security for workflows (responsibility of workflow authors)
- GitHub Actions platform security (covered by GitHub documentation)
- Operational security procedures for managing workflows
- Incident response or security monitoring procedures

### 1.3 Design Goals

The security architecture is designed to achieve:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple independent security layers
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions required for each operation
3. **Explicit Over Implicit**: Security controls are declarative and reviewable
4. **Fail Secure**: Security failures prevent execution rather than allowing degraded operation
5. **Auditability**: All security-relevant actions produce visible artifacts
6. **Composability**: Security controls can be combined and extended
7. **Transparency**: Generated workflows are human-readable and reviewable

---

## 2. Conformance

### 2.1 Conformance Classes

This specification defines three conformance classes:

#### 2.1.1 Basic Conformance

A **basic conforming implementation** MUST implement:

- Input sanitization layer (Section 4)
- Output isolation layer (Section 5)
- Permission management layer (Section 7)
- Compilation-time security checks (Section 10)

Basic conformance provides core security protections suitable for low-risk workflows.

#### 2.1.2 Standard Conformance

A **standard conforming implementation** MUST implement all basic conformance requirements plus:

- Network isolation layer (Section 6)
- Sandbox isolation layer (Section 8)
- Runtime security enforcement (Section 11)

Standard conformance is RECOMMENDED for production workflows handling sensitive data.

#### 2.1.3 Complete Conformance

A **complete conforming implementation** MUST implement all standard conformance requirements plus:

- Threat detection layer (Section 9)
- All optional security enhancements marked as RECOMMENDED

Complete conformance provides maximum security for high-risk workflows.

### 2.2 Requirements Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### 2.3 Compliance Levels

Implementations are evaluated at three compliance levels:

| Level | Description | Conformance Class |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Level 1** | Core security controls | Basic Conformance |
| **Level 2** | Production-ready security | Standard Conformance |
| **Level 3** | Maximum security hardening | Complete Conformance |

---

## 3. Security Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Multi-Layered Architecture

The security architecture employs six independent security layers that provide defense-in-depth:

### 3.2 Security Guarantees

A conforming implementation MUST provide the following security guarantees:

**SG-01**: Untrusted input SHALL NOT be directly interpolated into GitHub Actions expressions without sanitization.

> **Note**: This guarantee specifically protects against template injection in GitHub Actions expressions (e.g., `${{ github.event.issue.title }}`). It does not prevent AI agents from accessing untrusted data at runtime through MCP tools (e.g., GitHub MCP returning issue titles or PR bodies). Runtime access to untrusted data via tools is subject to prompt injection risks, which are mitigated through:
> - Threat detection layer (Section 9) analyzing agent behavior
> - Output isolation layer (Section 5) preventing direct write access
> - Network isolation layer (Section 6) restricting data exfiltration
> - Safe outputs validation (Section 5.4) checking output integrity

**SG-02**: AI agents SHALL NOT have direct write access to repository resources (issues, pull requests, discussions).

**SG-03**: Network access SHALL be restricted to explicitly allowed domains unless explicitly configured otherwise.

**SG-04**: Permissions SHALL follow the principle of least privilege with read-only defaults.

**SG-05**: AI agent processes SHALL execute in isolated sandbox environments.

**SG-06**: All security-relevant actions SHALL produce auditable artifacts (workflow logs, comments, pull requests).

**SG-07**: Security violations SHALL prevent workflow execution rather than allowing degraded operation.

### 3.3 Threat Model

The security architecture protects against:

1. **Template Injection**: Malicious input manipulating GitHub Actions expressions
2. **Prompt Injection**: Adversarial inputs manipulating AI agent behavior
   - **Via GitHub event context**: Mitigated through input sanitization layer (Section 4)
   - **Via MCP tool responses**: Mitigated through threat detection (Section 9), output isolation (Section 5), and network filtering (Section 6)
3. **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized data transmission to external services
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized elevation of permissions or capabilities
5. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised dependencies or actions
6. **Resource Exhaustion**: Denial of service through infinite loops or resource consumption

**Threat Model Clarification**: While the input sanitization layer prevents template injection through GitHub event context, AI agents may still access untrusted data at runtime through MCP tools. For example, the GitHub MCP server can return issue titles, PR bodies, and comments that were not pre-sanitized by the activation job. This is an accepted architectural tradeoff that enables dynamic workflows while relying on:
- **Threat detection**: Analyzes agent output for malicious behavior before execution
- **Output isolation**: Prevents agents from directly writing to repository resources
- **Network isolation**: Restricts data exfiltration to allowed domains only
- **Safe outputs validation**: Validates all output before execution

### 3.4 Security Principles

**SP-01 (Defense in Depth)**: Multiple independent security layers SHALL provide overlapping protections.

**SP-02 (Least Privilege)**: Components SHALL operate with the minimum permissions required.

**SP-03 (Fail Secure)**: Security failures SHALL prevent execution rather than degrading protections.

**SP-04 (Explicit Configuration)**: Security controls SHALL be declared explicitly in workflow definitions.

**SP-05 (Auditability)**: Security-relevant actions SHALL produce visible, persistent artifacts.

**SP-06 (Separation of Concerns)**: Read operations SHALL be separated from write operations.

---

## 4. Input Sanitization Layer

### 4.1 Overview

The input sanitization layer protects against template injection and prompt injection by processing all untrusted input through a sanitization pipeline before delivery to AI agents.

**Key Sanitization Features**:
- **Markdown Safety**: Neutralizes @mentions, bot command patterns, and GitHub references
- **URL Filtering**: Validates and redacts URLs against network allowlists, enforcing HTTPS-only policies
- **HTML/XML Tag Filtering**: Converts tags to safe HTML entities to prevent injection attacks
- **ANSI Escape Code Removal**: Strips terminal color codes and control characters
- **Content Limits**: Enforces size and line count restrictions with truncation
- **Protocol Sanitization**: Removes unsafe URL protocols (javascript:, data:, file:)

### 4.2 Sanitization Requirements

**IS-01**: A conforming implementation MUST sanitize all content from untrusted sources including:
- Issue titles and bodies
- Pull request titles and bodies
- Issue comments and PR review comments
- Commit messages
- User-provided input fields

**IS-02**: Sanitized content MUST be made available through a dedicated output variable (e.g., `needs.activation.outputs.text`).

**IS-03**: Workflows MUST NOT use raw GitHub event context (e.g., `github.event.issue.title`) directly in AI agent prompts.

### 4.3 Sanitization Procedures

#### 4.3.1 Mention Neutralization

**IS-04**: The implementation MUST neutralize @mentions by wrapping them in backticks:
- Input: `@username`
- Output: `` `@username` ``

This prevents unintended notifications and bot trigger abuse.

#### 4.3.2 Bot Trigger Protection

**IS-05**: The implementation MUST neutralize bot command patterns:
- Patterns like `fixes #123`, `/command`, `closes #456`
- MUST be wrapped in backticks: `` `fixes #123` ``

#### 4.3.3 HTML/XML Tag Filtering

**IS-06**: The implementation MUST convert HTML/XML tags to safe HTML entities:
- Open tags: `<tag>` → `&lt;tag&gt;`
- Close tags: `</tag>` → `&lt;/tag&gt;`
- Self-closing tags: `<tag/>` → `&lt;tag/&gt;`
- Attribute tags: `<tag attr="value">` → `&lt;tag attr="value"&gt;`

**IS-06a**: HTML entity conversion prevents:
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks via embedded JavaScript
- HTML injection that could manipulate rendered content
- XML External Entity (XXE) attacks in parsers
- Malformed markup that could break sanitization

**IS-06b**: XML comment removal MUST:
- Remove `<!-- comment -->` style comments
- Prevent comment-based obfuscation of malicious content
- Execute before tag conversion to ensure complete sanitization

#### 4.3.4 URL Filtering and Validation

**IS-07**: The implementation MUST validate and filter URLs:
- Only HTTPS URLs SHOULD be allowed (HTTP URLs MAY be permitted for specific allowlisted domains)
- URLs MUST match the network allowlist configuration
- Non-compliant URLs MUST be replaced with `(redacted)`
- Unsafe URL protocols MUST be removed: `javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`, `vbscript:`

**IS-07a**: URL domain validation MUST:
- Extract hostname from URLs
- Compare against allowed domains from network configuration
- Support wildcard matching (e.g., `*.github.com` matches `api.github.com`)
- Log redacted domains for security audit

**IS-07b**: Protocol sanitization MUST:
- Strip `javascript:` pseudo-protocol to prevent XSS
- Strip `data:` protocol to prevent data exfiltration
- Strip `file:` protocol to prevent local file access
- Preserve `https:` and allowlisted `http:` protocols only

#### 4.3.5 Content Limits

**IS-08**: The implementation MUST enforce content size limits:
- Maximum total size: 0.5 MB (524,288 bytes)
- Maximum line count: 65,536 lines
- Content exceeding limits MUST be truncated with a truncation notice

#### 4.3.6 Control Character Removal

**IS-09**: The implementation MUST remove control characters:
- ASCII control characters (0-31) except newline (10), tab (9), and carriage return (13)
- ANSI escape sequences used for terminal colors and formatting (e.g., `\x1b[31m`, `\x1b[0m`)
- Delete character (ASCII 127)

**IS-09a**: ANSI escape code removal prevents:
- Terminal injection attacks
- Obfuscation of malicious content via hidden characters
- Breaking of text processing pipelines
- Confusion in logs and audit trails

### 4.4 Sanitization Pipeline

**IS-10**: The sanitization pipeline MUST execute in the following order:

1. Extract raw content from GitHub event context
2. Remove ANSI escape sequences and control characters (IS-09)
3. Apply mention neutralization (IS-04)
4. Apply bot trigger protection (IS-05)
5. Remove XML comments
6. Convert HTML/XML tags to entities (IS-06)
7. Sanitize URL protocols (remove unsafe protocols)
8. Validate and filter URLs against allowlist (IS-07)
9. Apply content size limits and truncation (IS-08)
10. Store result in sanitized output variable

### 4.5 Bypass Prevention

**IS-11**: The implementation MUST prevent sanitization bypass:
- Workflows SHALL NOT access raw event context after sanitization is available
- The compiler MUST validate that AI prompts use sanitized variables
- Workflows using raw context MUST fail compilation with a clear error

---

## 5. Output Isolation Layer

### 5.1 Overview

The output isolation layer enforces separation between AI agent operations (read-only) and GitHub API operations (write access). This prevents AI agents from directly modifying repository resources while enabling validated automation.

### 5.2 Job Architecture

**OI-01**: A conforming implementation MUST separate workflow execution into distinct job types:

1. **Activation Job**: Performs sanitization and produces `needs.activation.outputs.text`
2. **Agent Job**: Executes AI agent with read-only permissions
3. **Safe Output Jobs**: Perform validated GitHub API operations with write permissions

**OI-02**: Agent jobs MUST NOT have write permissions to repository resources:
- `contents: read` (NOT `contents: write`)
- `issues: read` (NOT `issues: write`)
- `pull-requests: read` (NOT `pull-requests: write`)

### 5.3 Safe Output Configuration

**OI-03**: Write operations MUST be declared explicitly in workflow frontmatter using the `safe-outputs` configuration block.

**OI-04**: The implementation MUST support the following safe output types:
- `create-issue`: Create new issues
- `add-comment`: Add comments to issues/PRs
- `create-pull-request`: Create pull requests
- `create-discussion`: Create repository discussions
- `close-issue`: Close issues
- `close-pull-request`: Close pull requests
- `close-discussion`: Close discussions
- `mark-pull-request-as-ready-for-review`: Mark draft PRs as ready

**OI-05**: The implementation MAY support additional safe output types as extensions.

### 5.4 Output Validation

**OI-06**: Safe output jobs MUST validate agent output before execution:
- Output format MUST conform to expected JSON schema
- Required fields MUST be present
- Field values MUST pass type validation
- String lengths MUST be within configured limits

**OI-07**: Invalid output MUST cause workflow failure with a descriptive error message.

### 5.5 Token Management

**OI-08**: Safe output jobs MUST support configurable GitHub tokens:
- Individual safe output token: `safe-outputs.<type>.github-token`
- Global safe outputs token: `safe-outputs.github-token`
- Workflow-level token: `github-token`
- Default token: `${{ secrets.GH_AW_GITHUB_TOKEN || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`

**OI-09**: Token resolution MUST follow precedence order (highest to lowest):
1. Individual safe output token
2. Global safe outputs token
3. Workflow-level token
4. Default token

**OI-10**: Tokens MUST be GitHub Actions secret expressions (e.g., `${{ secrets.TOKEN_NAME }}`). Plaintext tokens MUST cause compilation failure.

### 5.6 Output Isolation Guarantees

**OI-11**: The implementation MUST guarantee:
- AI agents cannot directly execute GitHub API write operations
- All write operations are validated before execution
- Write operations execute in separate jobs with isolated permissions
- Failed validations prevent write operations from executing

---

## 6. Network Isolation Layer

### 6.1 Overview

The network isolation layer restricts network access for AI agents and MCP servers using domain allowlists and ecosystem identifiers.

### 6.2 Network Configuration

**NI-01**: A conforming implementation MUST support network access control through a `network` configuration field.

**NI-02**: The implementation MUST support three network access modes:

1. **Default Allowlist** (`network: defaults`): Basic infrastructure only
2. **Custom Allowlist** (`network: { allowed: [...] }`): Explicit domain list
3. **No Access** (`network: {}`): All network access denied

**NI-03**: If `network` is not specified, the implementation SHOULD default to `network: defaults`.

### 6.3 Ecosystem Identifiers

**NI-04**: The implementation MUST support ecosystem identifiers that expand to domain lists:

| Identifier | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `defaults` | Basic infrastructure (certificates, JSON schema, Ubuntu packages) |
| `github` | GitHub domains (github.com, githubusercontent.com, etc.) |
| `containers` | Container registries (Docker Hub, GHCR, Quay) |
| `python` | Python package ecosystem (PyPI, anaconda) |
| `node` | Node.js package ecosystem (npm, yarn) |
| `go` | Go package ecosystem |
| `java` | Java package ecosystem (Maven Central) |
| `dotnet` | .NET package ecosystem (NuGet) |
| `ruby` | Ruby package ecosystem (RubyGems) |
| `rust` | Rust package ecosystem (crates.io) |

**NI-05**: The implementation MAY support additional ecosystem identifiers as extensions.

### 6.4 Domain Allowlisting

**NI-06**: Individual domains in the `allowed` list MUST support:
- Exact domain matching (e.g., `api.example.com`)
- Automatic subdomain matching (e.g., `example.com` allows `api.example.com`)
- Wildcard patterns (e.g., `*.cdn.example.com`)

**NI-07**: The implementation SHOULD support protocol-specific filtering:
- `https://domain.com`: HTTPS-only access
- `http://domain.com`: HTTP-only access
- `domain.com`: Both HTTP and HTTPS

**NI-08**: The implementation MUST reject invalid protocols with compilation errors:
- Invalid: `ftp://`, `ws://`, `wss://`, etc.
- Error message MUST indicate valid protocols: `http://` and `https://`

### 6.5 Domain Blocking

**NI-09**: The implementation MUST support a `blocked` field for denying specific domains:

```yaml
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults
    - python
  blocked:
    - "tracker.example.com"
```

**NI-10**: Blocked domains MUST take precedence over allowed domains.

**NI-11**: The blocked list MUST support both individual domains and ecosystem identifiers.

### 6.6 Enforcement Mechanisms

**NI-12**: For AI engines, the implementation MUST enforce network restrictions using one of:
- Process-level firewall (e.g., AWF for Copilot)
- Container-level network policies
- Proxy-based filtering
- Engine-native network controls (e.g., Claude)

**NI-13**: For MCP servers in containers, the implementation MUST enforce network restrictions using:
- Container-level egress filtering (iptables, network policies)
- Per-container proxy configuration (e.g., Squid)
- MCP server network isolation

### 6.7 Content Sanitization Integration

**NI-14**: The network allowlist MUST also apply to content sanitization:
- URIs from non-allowed domains MUST be replaced with `(redacted)`
- GitHub domains SHOULD be allowed by default

---

## 7. Permission Management Layer

### 7.1 Overview

The permission management layer enforces least-privilege access control for workflow jobs using GitHub Actions permissions.

### 7.2 Permission Defaults

**PM-01**: A conforming implementation MUST set read-only permissions as the default:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
```

**PM-02**: Unspecified permissions MUST default to `none` (GitHub Actions default behavior).

### 7.3 Permission Configuration

**PM-03**: The implementation MUST support configuring permissions in workflow frontmatter:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: read
  pull-requests: read
```

**PM-04**: The implementation MUST support both permission shorthand and detailed configuration:

**Shorthand**: Top-level `permissions` field

**Detailed**: Job-level `permissions` within `jobs` configuration

### 7.4 Strict Mode

**PM-05**: The implementation MUST support a `strict` mode that enforces security restrictions:

**PM-06**: When `strict: true` is enabled, the implementation MUST:
- Block write permissions (`contents: write`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write`)
- Require use of safe outputs for write operations
- Apply secure network defaults unless explicitly configured
- Refuse wildcard (`*`) in network domains
- Require network configuration for custom MCP containers
- Enforce action pinning to commit SHAs
- Refuse deprecated frontmatter fields

**PM-07**: Violations of strict mode requirements MUST cause compilation failure with descriptive error messages.

### 7.5 Fork Protection

**PM-08**: For `pull_request` triggers, the implementation MUST:
- Block forks by default
- Generate repository ID comparison: `github.event.pull_request.head.repo.id == github.repository_id`
- Support explicit fork allowlisting via `forks` configuration

**PM-09**: For `workflow_run` triggers, the implementation MUST inject safety conditions:

```yaml
if: >
  (github.event.workflow_run.repository.id == github.repository_id) &&
  (!github.event.workflow_run.repository.fork)
```

### 7.6 Role-Based Access Control

**PM-10**: The implementation MUST support role-based execution restrictions:

```yaml
roles: [admin, maintainer, write]  # Default
roles: [admin, maintainer]         # Stricter
roles: all                         # Least restrictive
```

**PM-11**: Role checks MUST be performed at runtime using membership validation.

**PM-12**: Failed role checks MUST cancel workflow execution with a warning message.

### 7.7 Token Validation

**PM-13**: The implementation MUST validate that `github-token` fields contain GitHub Actions secret expressions.

**PM-14**: Plaintext tokens or environment variables MUST cause compilation failure.

**PM-15**: Valid token formats:
- `${{ secrets.TOKEN_NAME }}`
- `${{ secrets.ORG_TOKEN || secrets.FALLBACK_TOKEN }}`

---

## 8. Sandbox Isolation Layer

### 8.1 Overview

The sandbox isolation layer provides process-level and container-level isolation for AI agents and MCP servers.

### 8.2 Coding Agent Sandbox

**SI-01**: A conforming implementation MUST execute AI agents in isolated environments.

**SI-02**: The implementation MUST support agent sandbox types:
- **AWF (Agent Workflow Firewall)**: Container-based with network firewall (default)
- **Sandbox Runtime (SRT)**: Alternative container runtime (experimental)

**SI-03**: If no sandbox type is specified, the implementation MUST default to AWF.

### 8.3 AWF Sandbox Requirements

**SI-04**: The AWF sandbox MUST provide:
- Container-based process isolation
- Network egress control via iptables and domain-based allowlisting
- Chroot-based filesystem transparency (all host binaries accessible, no explicit mounts)
- Hidden Docker socket for security
- Automatic environment variable inheritance via `--env-all`
- Capability drop post-setup (CAP_NET_ADMIN, CAP_SYS_CHROOT)

**SI-05**: AWF chroot mode MUST enforce this filesystem access model:

| Path Type | Mode | Examples |
|-----------|------|----------|
| User paths | Read-write | `$HOME`, `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, `/tmp` |
| System paths | Read-only | `/usr`, `/opt`, `/bin`, `/lib` |
| Docker socket | Hidden | `/var/run/docker.sock` |

### 8.4 MCP Server Sandbox

**SI-08**: The implementation MUST execute MCP servers in isolated containers.

**SI-09**: MCP server containers MUST:
- Run with non-root UIDs
- Have dropped capabilities
- Use seccomp/AppArmor profiles
- Deny privilege escalation
- Have egress network filtering

**SI-10**: MCP server containers SHOULD:
- Be pinned to digests (e.g., `image@sha256:...`)
- Be scanned for vulnerabilities
- Have SBOMs tracked

### 8.5 Environment Variable Inheritance

**SI-06**: AWF MUST pass all environment variables via `--env-all` and implement PATH inheritance:
- Host `PATH` captured as `AWF_HOST_PATH` and restored inside container
- `GOROOT` explicitly captured after `actions/setup-go` (Go's trimmed binaries require it)
- Undefined variables silently ignored

### 8.6 Sandbox Guarantees

**SI-07**: The sandbox isolation layer MUST guarantee:
- Read-only system paths, read-write user paths only (`$HOME`, `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, `/tmp`)
- No Docker socket access
- Network access only to allowed domains (iptables enforcement independent of chroot)
- MCP servers in isolated containers with independent network allowlists
- Defense in depth: filesystem visibility (chroot) and network isolation (iptables) remain separate layers

## 9. Threat Detection Layer

### 9.1 Overview

The threat detection layer analyzes AI agent output for security threats before safe output jobs execute.

### 9.2 Threat Detection Requirements

**TD-01**: A conforming implementation with complete conformance MUST provide automated threat detection.

**TD-02**: Threat detection MUST be automatically enabled when `safe-outputs` is configured.

**TD-03**: The implementation MUST support disabling threat detection via `threat-detection: false`.

### 9.3 Detection Categories

**TD-04**: The implementation MUST detect the following threat categories:

1. **Prompt Injection**: Malicious instructions manipulating AI behavior
2. **Secret Leaks**: Exposed API keys, tokens, passwords, credentials
3. **Malicious Patches**: Code changes introducing vulnerabilities or backdoors

**TD-05**: The implementation MAY support additional threat categories as extensions.

### 9.4 Detection Methods

**TD-06**: The implementation MUST support AI-powered threat detection using configured AI engines.

**TD-07**: The implementation SHOULD support custom detection steps for specialized scanning:

```yaml
threat-detection:
  enabled: true
  steps:
    - name: Run TruffleHog
      uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
```

### 9.5 Detection Output

**TD-08**: Threat detection MUST produce structured JSON output:

```json
{
  "prompt_injection": false,
  "secret_leak": false,
  "malicious_patch": false,
  "reasons": []
}
```

**TD-09**: If any threat is detected (`true`), the workflow MUST fail and safe outputs MUST NOT execute.

**TD-10**: The `reasons` array SHOULD contain human-readable explanations for detected threats.

### 9.6 Custom Prompts

**TD-11**: The implementation MUST support custom detection prompts:

```yaml
threat-detection:
  prompt: "Focus on SQL injection vulnerabilities"
```

**TD-12**: Custom prompts MUST be appended to default detection instructions, not replace them.

### 9.7 Engine Configuration

**TD-13**: The implementation MUST support overriding the AI engine for threat detection:

```yaml
threat-detection:
  engine: "copilot"  # String format
```

**TD-14**: The implementation MUST support full engine configuration objects:

```yaml
threat-detection:
  engine:
    id: copilot
    model: gpt-4
    max-turns: 5
```

**TD-15**: The implementation MUST support disabling AI-powered detection:

```yaml
threat-detection:
  engine: false
  steps:  # Custom steps only
    - name: Static Analysis
      run: ./scan.sh
```

## 10. Compilation-Time Security Checks

### 10.1 Overview

Compilation-time security checks validate workflow definitions before generating executable workflows, preventing security misconfigurations from reaching runtime.

### 10.2 Schema Validation

**CS-01**: The implementation MUST validate workflow frontmatter against JSON schemas.

**CS-02**: Schema validation MUST check:
- Required fields are present
- Field types match specifications
- Field values are within allowed ranges
- Enum values are from allowed sets

**CS-03**: Schema validation failures MUST cause compilation failure with descriptive error messages indicating:
- Field path (e.g., `network.allowed[0]`)
- Validation failure reason
- Expected format or value range

### 10.3 Expression Safety

**CS-04**: The implementation MUST validate that GitHub Actions expressions do not use untrusted input:

**Unsafe patterns** (MUST reject):
- `${{ github.event.issue.title }}`
- `${{ github.event.comment.body }}`
- `${{ github.head_ref }}` (can be controlled by PR authors)

**Safe patterns** (MUST allow):
- `${{ github.actor }}`
- `${{ github.repository }}`
- `${{ github.run_id }}`
- `${{ needs.activation.outputs.text }}` (sanitized)

**CS-05**: Expression safety violations MUST cause compilation failure with suggestions for safe alternatives.

### 10.4 Permission Validation

**CS-06**: In strict mode, the implementation MUST reject write permissions:
- `contents: write`
- `issues: write`
- `pull-requests: write`
- `discussions: write`

**CS-07**: Permission validation MUST suggest using `safe-outputs` for write operations.

### 10.5 Network Validation

**CS-08**: The implementation MUST validate network configuration:
- Ecosystem identifiers are recognized
- Domain patterns are valid (no invalid wildcards)
- Protocol prefixes are valid (`http://`, `https://`, or none)
- Wildcard patterns (`*`) are not used in strict mode

**CS-09**: Network validation failures MUST cause compilation failure with suggestions for correction.

### 10.6 Action Pinning

**CS-10**: In strict mode, the implementation MUST enforce action pinning to commit SHAs:
- Actions MUST use format `owner/repo@SHA` (40-character hex)
- Tag references (e.g., `@v4`) MUST be rejected
- Branch references (e.g., `@main`) MUST be rejected

**CS-11**: Unpinned actions MUST cause compilation failure with suggestions to use SHA pins.

### 10.7 Deprecated Features

**CS-12**: In strict mode, the implementation MUST reject deprecated frontmatter fields.

**CS-13**: Deprecation errors MUST indicate:
- Deprecated field name
- Replacement field or pattern
- Migration instructions

---

## 11. Runtime Security Enforcement

### 11.1 Overview

Runtime security enforcement ensures security controls remain active during workflow execution.

### 11.2 Timestamp Validation

**RS-01**: The implementation MUST validate that compiled workflows are up-to-date with source definitions.

**RS-02**: Timestamp validation MUST compare:
- Source `.md` file modification time
- Compiled `.lock.yml` file modification time

**RS-03**: If source is newer than compiled workflow, the workflow MUST fail with a recompilation message.

### 11.3 Repository Validation

**RS-04**: For `pull_request` triggers, the implementation MUST validate repository ownership at runtime:

```yaml
if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.id == github.repository_id
```

**RS-05**: For `workflow_run` triggers, the implementation MUST validate:
- Repository ID match: `github.event.workflow_run.repository.id == github.repository_id`
- Not from fork: `!github.event.workflow_run.repository.fork`

### 11.4 Role Validation

**RS-06**: The implementation MUST validate user roles at workflow start.

**RS-07**: Role validation MUST use GitHub API membership checks.

**RS-08**: Failed role checks MUST cancel execution with a descriptive message.

### 11.5 Token Validation

**RS-09**: Safe output jobs MUST validate token format before use.

**RS-10**: The implementation MUST validate that tokens are secret expressions, not plaintext.

**RS-11**: Invalid tokens MUST cause job failure with a security warning.

### 11.6 Network Enforcement

**RS-12**: For AWF sandbox, network restrictions MUST be enforced via:
- Container networking configuration
- iptables egress rules
- Domain allowlist passed to firewall

**RS-13**: For MCP servers, network restrictions MUST be enforced via:
- Per-container Squid proxy
- iptables REDIRECT rules
- Container network isolation

### 11.7 Output Validation

**RS-14**: Safe output jobs MUST validate agent output structure:
- JSON parsing success
- Schema conformance
- Required fields present
- Field types correct

**RS-15**: Invalid output MUST cause job failure with validation error details.

### 11.8 Concurrency Control

**RS-16**: The implementation MUST configure automatic concurrency control to prevent race conditions and resource conflicts.

**RS-17**: Concurrency control MUST use GitHub Actions' native `concurrency` field with:
- Group identifier that uniquely identifies the workflow context
- Optional `cancel-in-progress` flag for workflow cancellation behavior

**RS-18**: The implementation SHOULD use dynamic group identifiers that include:
- Workflow name or identifier
- Context-specific identifiers (issue number, PR number, or ref)

**RS-19**: Example concurrency configurations:

```yaml
# For pull request workflows
concurrency:
  group: "gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}"
  cancel-in-progress: true

# For issue-based workflows
concurrency:
  group: "gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.issue.number }}"
```

**RS-20**: Concurrency control provides operational security by:
- Preventing multiple concurrent runs on the same resource
- Avoiding race conditions in shared state
- Reducing resource exhaustion risks
- Ensuring sequential processing when required

**RS-21**: The `cancel-in-progress` flag SHOULD be set to `true` for workflows where:
- Latest run supersedes previous runs (e.g., PR review workflows)
- Multiple runs on the same context would cause conflicts
- Resource conservation is important

**RS-22**: The `cancel-in-progress` flag SHOULD be set to `false` or omitted for workflows where:
- All runs must complete (e.g., audit workflows)
- Cancellation could leave inconsistent state
- Sequential queueing is preferred over cancellation

### Appendix B: Sanitization Examples

#### Example 1: @Mention Neutralization

**Input**:
```markdown
@octocat please review this PR
```

**Output**:
```markdown
`@octocat` please review this PR
```

#### Example 2: Bot Trigger Protection

**Input**:
```markdown
This fixes #123 and closes #456
```

**Output**:
```markdown
This `fixes #123` and `closes #456`
```

#### Example 3: XML/HTML Tag Conversion

**Input**:
```html
<script>alert('xss')</script>
<img src="x" onerror="alert('xss')"/>
```

**Output**:
```text
&lt;script&gt;alert('xss')&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;img src="x" onerror="alert('xss')"/&gt;
```

#### Example 4: URL Filtering and Validation

**Input** (with network allowlist: `defaults`, `github.com`):
```text
Check https://github.com/example/repo
Visit https://malicious.example.com
Download javascript:alert('xss')
See data:text/html,<script>alert('xss')</script>
```

**Output**:
```text
Check https://github.com/example/repo
Visit (redacted)
Download (redacted)
See (redacted)
```

**Explanation**:
- `github.com` URL preserved (in allowlist)
- `malicious.example.com` redacted (not in allowlist)
- `javascript:` protocol stripped and URL redacted (unsafe protocol)
- `data:` protocol stripped and URL redacted (unsafe protocol)

#### Example 5: ANSI Escape Code Removal

**Input**:
```text
\x1b[31mError: failed\x1b[0m
\x1b[1;32mSuccess!\x1b[0m
```

**Output**:
```text
Error: failed
Success!
```

**Explanation**: Terminal color codes (`\x1b[...m`) removed to prevent terminal injection.

#### Example 6: Comprehensive Sanitization

**Input** (markdown with multiple threats):
```markdown
Hey @admin, please run this: <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
Check out https://phishing.example.com/steal?data=\x1b[31msecret\x1b[0m
This fixes #1 and /deploy to prod
```

**Output** (with allowlist: `defaults`, `github.com`):
```markdown
Hey `@admin`, please run this: &lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;
Check out (redacted)
This `fixes #1` and `/deploy` to prod
```

**Protections Applied**:
1. @mention neutralized (prevents notification spam)
2. HTML `<script>` tag converted to entities (prevents XSS)
3. Non-allowlisted URL redacted (prevents phishing)
4. ANSI escape codes removed (prevents terminal injection)
5. Bot triggers neutralized (prevents unintended commands)

### Appendix C: Network Configuration Examples

#### Example 1: Default Infrastructure Only

```yaml
network: defaults
```

**Allowed domains**: Certificates, JSON schema, Ubuntu packages, Microsoft sources.

#### Example 2: Selective Ecosystem Access

```yaml
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults
    - github
    - python
    - node
```

**Allowed domains**: Defaults + GitHub + PyPI + npm/yarn.

#### Example 3: Custom Domain with Protocol Filtering

```yaml
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults
    - "https://api.example.com"
    - "http://legacy-internal.corp"
```

**Allowed**: HTTPS to api.example.com, HTTP to legacy-internal.corp.

#### Example 4: Domain Blocking

```yaml
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults
    - python
  blocked:
    - "tracker.pypi.org"
    - "analytics.python.org"
```

**Result**: Python ecosystem minus tracking domains.

### Appendix D: Safe Output Configuration Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Issue Creation

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
```

**Generates**: Job that creates issues from agent JSON output.

#### Example 2: Multiple Output Types with Custom Tokens

```yaml
github-token: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_TOKEN }}

safe-outputs:
  github-token: ${{ secrets.SAFE_OUTPUT_TOKEN }}
  
  create-issue:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.ISSUE_TOKEN }}
  
  create-pull-request:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.PR_TOKEN }}
```

**Token resolution**:
- create-issue: Uses `ISSUE_TOKEN`
- create-pull-request: Uses `PR_TOKEN`

#### Example 3: With Threat Detection

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
  threat-detection:
    enabled: true
    prompt: "Focus on SQL injection vulnerabilities"
    steps:
      - name: Run TruffleHog
        uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
```

**Behavior**: AI detection + TruffleHog scan before PR creation.

#### Example 4: Concurrency Control

```yaml
# Pull request workflow with cancel-in-progress
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

concurrency:
  group: "gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}"
  cancel-in-progress: true

safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
```

**Behavior**: Newer runs cancel older runs for the same PR, ensuring only the latest code is analyzed.

```yaml
# Issue workflow with sequential processing
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]

concurrency:
  group: "gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.issue.number }}"
  # cancel-in-progress: false (omitted = queue runs sequentially)

safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
```

**Behavior**: All workflow runs complete in order, preventing incomplete operations.

### Appendix E: Concurrency Control Examples

#### Example 1: Pull Request Workflow with Cancellation

```yaml
name: PR Review Agent
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review]

concurrency:
  group: "gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}"
  cancel-in-progress: true

safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
```

**Group pattern**: `gh-aw-PR Review Agent-123` (where 123 is PR number)

**Behavior**: 
- When a new commit is pushed to PR #123, any in-progress run for that PR is cancelled
- Only the latest code version is analyzed, avoiding outdated feedback
- Resource-efficient for rapidly changing PRs

#### Example 2: Issue Workflow with Sequential Processing

```yaml
name: Issue Triage
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]

concurrency:
  group: "gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.issue.number }}"
  # cancel-in-progress: false (default)

safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
  add-comment:
```

**Group pattern**: `gh-aw-Issue Triage-456` (where 456 is issue number)

**Behavior**:
- Multiple runs on the same issue queue sequentially
- Each run completes before the next starts
- Ensures all operations complete without cancellation
- Prevents race conditions in issue state

#### Example 3: Scheduled Workflow without Concurrency Conflicts

```yaml
name: Daily Audit
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:

concurrency:
  group: "gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}"
  # No PR/issue number = single group for all runs

safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
```

**Group pattern**: `gh-aw-Daily Audit` (same for all runs)

**Behavior**:
- Only one run of this workflow can execute at a time
- Manual triggers queue behind scheduled runs
- Prevents overlapping audit operations

#### Example 4: Repository-Wide Lock

```yaml
name: Database Migration
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

concurrency:
  group: "gh-aw-database-migration-${{ github.repository }}"
  cancel-in-progress: false

safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
```

**Group pattern**: `gh-aw-database-migration-owner/repo`

**Behavior**:
- Repository-wide exclusive lock
- Runs queue sequentially across the entire repository
- Critical for operations that must not overlap

### Appendix F: Strict Mode Violations

#### Violation 1: Write Permissions

```yaml
strict: true
permissions:
  contents: write  # ❌ Blocked in strict mode
```

**Error**: `strict mode does not allow write permissions, use safe-outputs instead`

#### Violation 2: Unpinned Actions

```yaml
strict: true
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4  # ❌ Blocked in strict mode
```

**Error**: `strict mode requires actions to be pinned to commit SHA, not tag`

#### Violation 3: Wildcard Network

```yaml
strict: true
network:
  allowed:
    - "*"  # ❌ Blocked in strict mode
```

**Error**: `strict mode does not allow wildcard (*) in network domains`

### Appendix G: Security Best Practices

#### BP-01: Always Use Sanitized Context

**Don't**:
```yaml
prompt: |
  Analyze this issue: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
```

**Do**:
```yaml
prompt: |
  Analyze this issue: ${{ needs.activation.outputs.text }}
```

#### BP-02: Enable Strict Mode for Production

**Don't**:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
```

**Do**:
```yaml
strict: true
permissions:
  contents: read
  
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
  add-comment:
```

#### BP-03: Use Specific Domain Allowlists

**Don't**:
```yaml
network:
  allowed:
    - "*"  # Too broad
```

**Do**:
```yaml
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults
    - github
    - python
    - "api.internal.example.com"
```

#### BP-04: Pin Actions to SHAs

**Don't**:
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: actions/setup-node@main
```

**Do**:
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@8e8c483db84b4bee98b60c0593521ed34d9990e8 # v6
- uses: actions/setup-node@1e60f620b9541d16bece96c5465dc8ee9832be0b # v4.0.3
```

#### BP-05: Enable Threat Detection

**Don't**:
```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
  threat-detection: false  # Risky
```

**Do**:
```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
  threat-detection:
    enabled: true
    prompt: "Focus on security vulnerabilities specific to this codebase"
```

#### BP-06: Use Role-Based Access Control

**Don't**:
```yaml
roles: all  # Allows any user in public repos
```

**Do**:
```yaml
roles: [admin, maintainer]  # Restrict to trusted roles
```
