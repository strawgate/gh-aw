#    - The standard GITHUB_TOKEN does NOT have permission to assign bot agents
#    - Create a PAT at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
#    - Add it as a repository secret named GH_AW_AGENT_TOKEN

# 2. All four workflow permissions declared above (for the safe output job)

# Assign to Agent with Model Test Workflow

This workflow tests the `assign_to_agent` safe output feature with the new `model` parameter.

## Task

Assign the Copilot agent to the issue with the specified AI model. The workflow demonstrates:

1. **Default model configuration**: Set via `safe-outputs.assign-to-agent.model` in frontmatter (applies to all assignments in the workflow)

**For issues event:**
Assign the Copilot agent using the default model (Claude Opus 4.6) to the triggering issue.

**For workflow_dispatch:**
Assign the Copilot agent to issue #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }} using the default model configured in the frontmatter.

Use the `assign_to_agent` tool from the `safeoutputs` MCP server:

```
assign_to_agent(issue_number=<issue_number>, agent="copilot")
```

The model is configured at the workflow level in the frontmatter and applies to all assignments.

Available models include:
- `auto` - Auto-select model (default, currently Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- `claude-sonnet-4.5` - Claude Sonnet 4.5
- `claude-opus-4.5` - Claude Opus 4.5
- `claude-opus-4.6` - Claude Opus 4.6
- `gpt-5.1-codex-max` - GPT-5.1 Codex Max
- `gpt-5.2-codex` - GPT-5.2 Codex
