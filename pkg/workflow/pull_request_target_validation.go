// This file provides validation for pull_request_target trigger security.
//
// # pull_request_target Trigger Validation
//
// The pull_request_target trigger runs workflows in the context of the base
// (target) branch with full write permissions and access to repository secrets.
// Unlike pull_request, it can access secrets from fork PRs, making it extremely
// dangerous when combined with a checkout of PR code.
//
// # Validation Rules
//
//  1. In strict mode: always emit a warning that pull_request_target is a very
//     dangerous trigger, even when checkout: false is set, because the workflow
//     still runs with full write permissions and secret access.
//
//  2. When checkout is NOT explicitly disabled (checkout: false not set):
//     - In strict mode: return a hard error (extremely insecure).
//     - In non-strict mode: emit a warning.
//
// # References
//
// See: https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
//
// # When to Add Validation Here
//
// Add validation to this file when:
//   - It validates pull_request_target-specific security requirements.
//   - It enforces checkout restrictions for this trigger type.
//
// For general validation, see validation.go.
// For detailed documentation, see scratchpad/validation-architecture.md

// on the base branch. When checkout is not explicitly disabled (checkout: false), the workflow
// may execute untrusted PR code with elevated privileges — a critical security vulnerability
// commonly known as a "pwn request" attack.
//
// In strict mode, a warning is always emitted that pull_request_target is inherently dangerous
// even with checkout disabled, since the workflow still runs with elevated permissions.
