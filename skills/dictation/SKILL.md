## Fix Speech-to-Text Errors

When fixing dictated text, correct these common misrecognitions:

### GitHub and Git Terms
- "get hub" → github
- "git lab" → gitlab  
- "get actions" → github-actions
- "pull request" → pull-request (when used as compound modifier)
- "issue ops" → issueops
- "label ops" → labelops
- "chat ops" → chatops
- "multi repo ops" → multirepoops
- "project ops" → projectops

### Workflow Configuration
- "front matter" → frontmatter
- "safe outputs" → safe-outputs (in configuration context)
- "safe inputs" → safe-inputs (in configuration context)
- "lock file" → lockfile or .lock.yml (depending on context)
- "tool sets" → toolsets
- "M.C.P." or "M C P" → MCP
- "repo memory" → repo-memory (in configuration context)
- "cache memory" → cache-memory (in configuration context)

### AI Engines
- "co-pilot" → copilot
- "code x" → codex
- "cloud" → claude (when referring to AI)

### Commands and Operations
- "G.H. A.W." → gh-aw or gh aw (depending on context)
- "compile workflow" → compile (command), workflow compilation (process)
- "re-compile" → recompile
- "work flow dispatch" → workflow_dispatch
- "timeout minutes" → timeout-minutes

### File Formats and Extensions
- "dot M.D." → .md
- "dot Y.A.M.L." or "dot Y M L" → .yaml or .yml
- "dot lock dot Y M L" → .lock.yml
- "N.D. JSON" → NDJSON
- "jason" → JSON (when referring to format)

### Technical Patterns
- "A.P.I." → API
- "U.R.L." → URL
- "H.T.T.P." → HTTP
- "H.T.T.P.S." → HTTPS
- "S.H.A." → SHA
- "C.I. C.D." → CI/CD
- "S.S.H." → SSH

### Hyphenation Rules
Use hyphens for compound modifiers (adjective + noun modifying another noun):
- "read only access" → read-only access
- "write capable token" → write-capable token
- "pre approved actions" → pre-approved actions
- "security critical operations" → security-critical operations

Omit hyphens when used as predicate:
- "The access is read only" (no hyphen)
- "We need read-only access" (hyphen)

### Common Ambiguities
- "their/there/they're" → use context to determine correct spelling
- "its/it's" → its (possessive), it's (it is)
- "your/you're" → your (possessive), you're (you are)
- "too/to/two" → use context to determine correct spelling

## Clean Up and Improve Text

Remove filler words and improve clarity:

### Remove These Filler Words
- humm, um, uh, uhh, umm
- you know, like, basically, actually, literally
- kind of, sort of, I mean, I think
- right?, okay?, so yeah, well

### Improve Clarity
1. Remove redundant phrases:
   - "in order to" → "to"
   - "at this point in time" → "now"
   - "due to the fact that" → "because"
   - "in the event that" → "if"

2. Make text more concise:
   - Remove unnecessary qualifiers (very, really, quite)
   - Use active voice instead of passive voice
   - Replace wordy phrases with simpler alternatives

3. Maintain technical accuracy:
   - Keep all technical terms from the glossary
   - Preserve code examples and commands exactly
   - Don't simplify technical concepts

## Guidelines

You do not have enough background information to plan or provide code examples.

**What to do:**
- Fix speech-to-text errors using the glossary and correction rules above
- Remove filler words (humm, you know, um, uh, like, basically, actually, etc.)
- Improve clarity and make text more professional
- Maintain the user's intended meaning
- Preserve technical accuracy

**What NOT to do:**
- Do NOT generate code examples
- Do NOT plan steps or provide implementation details
- Do NOT add information not present in the original text
- Do NOT change the meaning or intent of the text
- Do NOT remove technical terminology

Focus exclusively on correcting speech-to-text errors and improving text quality.
