**Statistics (Attribution-Verified)**: **31 discussions created** → **25 issues spawned** → **16 merged / 20 total PRs (80% merge rate)**

**Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/terminal-stylist.md` (runs daily)

- [#8653: Add comprehensive console formatting documentation](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/pull/8653) (CLOSED)

**Pattern**: Terminal Stylist is a **discussion-first workflow** by design. It analyzes console output patterns daily and creates discussion-based analysis reports with specific recommendations. Other agents (Discussion Task Miner, Plan Command) then mine those discussions for actionable tasks, creating issues that lead to PRs. This demonstrates the **multi-agent collaboration pattern**: one agent identifies opportunities, others extract tasks, and yet another implements fixes.

**Data Source**: Complete discussion dataset (2,281 discussions) fetched from GitHub API. 31 discussions extracted with proper "AI generated by [Terminal Stylist]" attribution.

**Blog Addition Suggestion**:
```markdown
Terminal Stylist demonstrates multi-agent collaboration at its best. The workflow creates **31 daily analysis reports** as discussions, which are then mined by Discussion Task Miner and Plan Command into **25 actionable issues**. Those issues spawned **16 merged PRs (80% merge rate)** improving console output across the codebase — from Charmbracelet integration to progress bars to stderr routing. Terminal Stylist never creates PRs directly; instead, it identifies opportunities that other agents implement, showing how workflows can collaborate through GitHub's discussion → issue → PR pipeline.
```

#### Plan Command ✅
**Statistics (Attribution-Verified)**: **514 merged / 761 total PRs (67% merge rate)**

**Query**: `"^\[plan\]|^plan:|/plan"`

**Pattern**: On-demand task decomposition via `/plan` command - breaks down issues into actionable sub-tasks

**Example Causal Chain** (Discussion → Issue → PR):
- **Discussion #7631**: "Workflow compilation success rate" discussion  
- **Issue #8058**: Planning Assistant extracted task: "Audit failing workflows and improve validation messages"
- **PR #8110**: Copilot Coding Assistant created PR: "Clarify shared workflow component errors and document 100% standalone compilation rate"
- **Attribution**: PR attributed to "Planning Assistant" showing causal chain works correctly

**Blog Addition Suggestion**:
```markdown
Plan Command has contributed **514 merged PRs out of 761 proposed (67% merge rate)**, providing on-demand task decomposition that breaks complex issues into actionable sub-tasks. This is the highest-volume workflow by attribution.
```

#### Discussion Task Miner ✅
**Statistics (Attribution-Verified)**: **60 merged / 105 total PRs (57% merge rate)**

**Query**: `"task.miner|task miner|discussion.*task"`

**Pattern**: Extracts actionable tasks from discussion threads - ensures insights don't get lost in conversations

**Example Causal Chain** (Discussion → Issue → PR):
- **Discussion #13934**: "Daily Compiler Code Quality Report discussion" identified missing test file
- **Issue #14084**: Discussion Task Miner extracted task: "Create test file for compiler_yaml_main_job.go"  
- **PR #14129**: Copilot Coding Assistant created PR (attributed to Discussion Task Miner): "Add unit tests for compiler_yaml_main_job.go"

**Additional Example PRs** (Recent, Merged, Attribution-Verified):
- [#13920: Fix firewall SSL-bump field extraction in frontmatter parser](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/pull/13920)
- [#13918: Add security rationale to permissions documentation](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/pull/13918)

**Blog Addition Suggestion**:
```markdown
Discussion Task Miner has contributed **60 merged PRs out of 105 proposed (57% merge rate)**, continuously scanning discussions to extract actionable tasks that might otherwise be lost. The workflow demonstrates perfect causal chain attribution: when it creates an issue from a discussion, and Copilot Coding Assistant later fixes that issue, the resulting PR is correctly attributed to Discussion Task Miner.
