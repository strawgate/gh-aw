# Agentic Engine Architecture Review

**Date**: 2026-02-17  
**Reviewer**: AI Agent  
**Scope**: Deep review of agentic engine interface and implementations

## Executive Summary

The agentic engine architecture is **well-designed and ready for extension**. The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) implementation provides excellent flexibility for adding new engines while maintaining backward compatibility. Minor improvements and comprehensive documentation have been added to further enhance extensibility.

### Key Findings

✅ **Strengths**:
- Interface segregation is well-implemented
- BaseEngine provides sensible defaults
- All engines implement required interfaces correctly
- Clear separation between engine-specific and shared code
- Good test coverage for interface compliance

⚠️ **Minor Improvements Needed**:
- Documentation for adding new engines was missing (now added)
- No centralized guide for engine implementers (now added)

## Architecture Analysis

### Interface Design

The architecture uses 7 focused interfaces composed into a single composite interface:

```
CodingAgentEngine (composite)
├── Engine (core identity)
├── CapabilityProvider (feature detection)
├── WorkflowExecutor (compilation)
├── MCPConfigProvider (MCP config)
├── LogParser (log analysis)
└── SecurityProvider (security features)
```

**Assessment**: ✅ **Excellent**. This design follows SOLID principles and allows engines to implement only what they need via BaseEngine embedding.

### Current Implementations

| Engine | Status | Complexity | Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Copilot | Production | High | Modular organization (7 files), full MCP support, firewall |
| Claude | Production | Medium | Full MCP support, firewall, max-turns |
| Codex | Production | Medium | TOML config, firewall, LLM gateway |
| Custom | Production | Low | User-defined steps, minimal features |

**Assessment**: ✅ **Good variety**. Implementations range from simple (Custom) to complex (Copilot), providing good examples for new engine authors.

### Registry & Validation

The engine registry (`EngineRegistry`) provides:
- Centralized registration
- Lookup by ID or prefix
- Validation of engine IDs
- Plugin support validation

**Assessment**: ✅ **Well-designed**. The registry pattern allows dynamic engine discovery and validation.

### Shared Utilities

Key helper functions in `engine_helpers.go`:
- `GenerateNpmInstallSteps()` - npm package installation
- `GenerateSecretValidationStep()` - secret validation
- `GenerateMultiSecretValidationStep()` - multi-secret validation
- `BuildAWFCommand()` - firewall integration
- `FilterEnvForSecrets()` - security filtering

**Assessment**: ✅ **Excellent**. Shared utilities reduce code duplication and ensure consistency.
