# mdflow Deep Research: Custom Engine Opportunities and Comparative Analysis

**Date**: 2026-01-04  
**Repository**: https://github.com/johnlindquist/mdflow  
**Status**: Deep Technical Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a deep technical analysis of mdflow and GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw), focusing on custom engine opportunities, architectural patterns, and strategic insights for gh-aw development. While the existing `mdflow-comparison.md` provides a detailed syntax comparison, this document focuses on **what gh-aw can learn from mdflow** and **opportunities for custom engine development**.

### Key Findings

1. **Custom Engine Opportunities**: mdflow's architecture demonstrates local-execution patterns applicable to gh-aw custom engines
2. **Template System**: mdflow's LiquidJS template system with special variables offers inspiration for enhanced gh-aw template capabilities
3. **Import Mechanism**: mdflow's flexible import system (glob, line ranges, symbol extraction) significantly exceeds gh-aw's capabilities
4. **Security vs Flexibility**: Fundamental tradeoff between mdflow's "trust the user" model and gh-aw's "security-first" approach

---

## Part 1: Custom Engine Opportunities for gh-aw

### Opportunity 1: mdflow-Style Custom Engine

**Concept**: Create a custom engine for gh-aw that mimics mdflow's execution model for local workflows.

#### Architecture

```yaml
---
engine: mdflow-local
engine:
  command: claude
  mode: print  # or interactive
  frontmatter-to-flags: true
tools:
  filesystem: read-write  # For local execution
  bash: ["*"]  # Allow all commands (staged mode restriction)
---
```

**Implementation Path**:
1. Create `mdflow_local_engine.go` in `pkg/workflow/`
2. Implement `CodingAgentEngine` interface
3. Support frontmatter-to-CLI-flags translation
4. Enable local file imports with glob support
5. Add LiquidJS template engine (or Go alternative)

**Use Case**: Allow users to run mdflow-style workflows locally via gh-aw compile, then execute in GitHub Actions with restrictions.

#### Benefits
- Bridge the gap between local ad-hoc tasks and CI/CD automation
- Provide migration path from mdflow to gh-aw
- Test workflows locally before deploying to GitHub

#### Challenges
- Security implications of allowing broader tool access
- Maintaining gh-aw's security guarantees
- Template engine compatibility (LiquidJS vs GitHub expressions)

---

### Opportunity 2: Enhanced Template Variable System

**mdflow Pattern**:
```yaml
---
_feature_name: Authentication
_target_dir: src/features
---
Build {{ _feature_name }} in {{ _target_dir }}.
```

**gh-aw Enhancement**:
```yaml
---
template-vars:
  feature_name: Authentication
  target_dir: src/features
---
Build ${{ vars.feature_name }} in ${{ vars.target_dir }}.
```

**Implementation**:
- Add `template-vars` frontmatter section
- Pre-process markdown to replace template variables before GitHub Actions compilation
- Support workflow_dispatch inputs as template variables
- Enable conditional sections with `{% if %}` style syntax

**Benefit**: Enables dynamic prompt generation and reusability across workflows.

---

### Opportunity 3: Advanced Import System

**mdflow Capabilities**:
```markdown
# File imports with glob
@./src/**/*.ts

# Line ranges
@./src/api.ts:10-50

# Symbol extraction (TypeScript/JavaScript)
@./src/types.ts#UserInterface
@./src/api.ts#fetchUser

# URL imports (cached)
@https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/README.md

# Command inlines
Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
```

**gh-aw Current State**:
```yaml
---
imports:
  - shared/mcp/gh-aw.md
  - shared/jqschema.md
---
```

**Proposed Enhancement**:

```yaml
---
imports:
  files:
    - path: src/**/*.ts
      glob: true
    - path: src/api.ts
      lines: [10, 50]
    - path: src/types.ts
      symbols: [UserInterface, UserConfig]
  urls:
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/org/repo/main/GUIDE.md
      cache: 1h
  commands:
    - git branch --show-current
    - gh issue list --state open --json number,title
---
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Extend import parser in `pkg/workflow/imports.go`
2. Add glob support using `filepath.Match`
3. Implement line range extraction
4. Add symbol extraction for Go/TypeScript (using AST parsers)
5. Support URL fetching with caching layer
6. Enable command execution during compilation (security: staged mode only)

**Security Considerations**:
- URL imports: Only from allowlisted domains (GitHub, verified sources)
- Command execution: Only in non-strict mode, warn users
- Symbol extraction: Safe AST parsing, no code execution

---

### Opportunity 4: Interactive Workflow Mode

**mdflow Pattern**:
```markdown
# File: debug.i.claude.md
---
_interactive: true
---
Let's debug this issue interactively.
```

**gh-aw Adaptation**:
```yaml
---
engine: copilot
mode: interactive
on: workflow_dispatch
tools:
  bash: ["gh", "git"]
  github: { toolsets: [repos, issues] }
---
Interactive debugging session for issue #${{ inputs.issue_number }}
```

**Implementation**:
- Add `mode: interactive` to engine config
- Generate GitHub Actions workflow with `workflow_dispatch` trigger
- Enable step-by-step execution with approval gates
- Support multi-turn conversations with state persistence

**Use Case**: Manual intervention workflows where human reviews each AI action before execution.

---

## Part 2: Architectural Strengths Analysis

### mdflow Strengths

#### 1. **Extreme Simplicity**
- **Line Count**: ~32,584 lines of TypeScript
- **Core Concept**: Filename → Command mapping
- **Zero Config**: Works immediately with `mdflow task.claude.md`

**Lesson for gh-aw**: Provide "Quick Start" templates that abstract complexity:
```bash
gh aw init basic-issue-responder
# Generates pre-configured workflow with sensible defaults
```

#### 2. **Unix Philosophy Adherence**
```bash
# Composability
git diff | mdflow review.claude.md

# Chaining
mdflow plan.claude.md | mdflow implement.codex.md

# Scripting
for file in *.md; do mdflow "$file"; done
```

**Lesson for gh-aw**: Consider adding `gh aw run` for local execution:
```bash
gh aw run workflow.md --local --staged
# Run workflow locally with safety restrictions
```

#### 3. **Transparent Mapping**
- Frontmatter keys directly become CLI flags (no magic)
- Direct mapping: `model: opus` → `--model opus`
- Debugging through transparent command output: `mdflow explain task.claude.md`

**Lesson for gh-aw**: Add `gh aw explain` command:
```bash
gh aw explain workflow.md
# Shows: compiled YAML, tool permissions, network access, etc.
```

#### 4. **Fast Iteration**
- No compilation step (interprets markdown directly)
- Immediate feedback loop
- Local execution means no CI/CD wait times

**Lesson for gh-aw**: Hybrid approach:
1. `gh aw compile --watch` for live recompilation
2. Local execution mode for testing
3. Dry-run with simulated GitHub context

#### 5. **Flexible Context Inclusion**
```markdown
# Multiple import mechanisms
@./src/**/*.ts              # All TypeScript files
@./docs/API.md:50-100       # Specific lines
@./types.ts#UserInterface   # Specific symbol
!`git log --oneline -10`    # Command output
```

**Architecture**: 
- Parser in `src/imports-parser.ts` (573 lines)
- Resolver in `src/imports-resolver.ts` (multiple strategies)
- Symbol extraction using `remark-parse` and AST traversal

**Strength**: Context gathering is a first-class feature, not an afterthought.

---

### gh-aw Strengths

#### 1. **Security by Design**
```yaml
---
permissions: read  # Default
safe-outputs:      # Only way to write
  create-issue:
strict: true       # Enforces security policies
network:           # Explicit allowlist
  allowed:
    - defaults
---
```

**Architecture**:
- Compile-time validation (`pkg/workflow/validation.go`, 782 lines)
- Runtime sandboxing (Docker containers, network firewall)
- Action SHA pinning for supply chain security
- Template injection prevention

**Strength**: Workflows can be safely shared and run by untrusted users.

#### 2. **GitHub-Native Integration**
- Direct access to GitHub API via `safe-outputs`
- GitHub Actions expressions (`${{ github.event.* }}`)
- Secrets management via `${{ secrets.* }}`
- Native support for all GitHub triggers

**Architecture**:
- Safe output handlers (`pkg/workflow/safe_outputs*.go`, multiple files)
- GitHub API integration (`pkg/workflow/create_*.go` pattern)
- Event-driven triggers with full GitHub Actions compatibility

**Strength**: Workflows are first-class GitHub citizens, not external scripts.

#### 3. **Team Collaboration**
- Version controlled workflows (`.md` + `.lock.yml`)
- Shared across repository collaborators
- Auditable execution history in Actions UI
- Role-based access controls

**Strength**: Enterprise-ready with compliance and audit trails.

#### 4. **Structured Output**
```yaml
---
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    title: "Auto-generated issue"
    labels: ["ai-generated", "needs-review"]
  create-pull-request:
    draft: true
---
```

**Architecture**:
- Output validation and sanitization
- Structured GitHub API calls (not just stdout)
- Max limits per workflow run
- Mentions detection and sanitization

**Strength**: AI output is actionable and integrated into GitHub workflow.

#### 5. **Compile-Time Validation**
- Schema validation against GitHub Actions spec
- MCP server configuration validation
- Network permissions validation
- Tool allowlist verification

**Architecture**: JSON schemas in `pkg/parser/schemas/` embedded in binary.

**Strength**: Errors caught before deployment, not at runtime.

---

## Part 3: Architectural Weaknesses Analysis

### mdflow Weaknesses

#### 1. **No Security Model**
```yaml
---
dangerously-skip-permissions: true
---
Delete all my files.
```

**Risk**: AI agent has full system access. Malicious or buggy prompts can cause damage.

**Impact**: Cannot be safely used in:
- Shared environments
- CI/CD pipelines
- Untrusted workflows
- Multi-user systems

**Mitigation in mdflow**: Trust model—user verifies markdown before running.

#### 2. **No Validation**
- Frontmatter keys passed directly to commands (no schema)
- No type checking of values
- Typos in flags silently ignored
- No verification of tool availability

**Example**:
```yaml
---
model: opus-pro-max-ultra  # Invalid model, but mdflow doesn't know
---
```

**Impact**: Errors surface at runtime, not compile time.

#### 3. **Local Execution Only**
- No cloud execution support
- No scheduled runs
- No event-driven triggers
- Manual invocation required

**Impact**: Not suitable for:
- Automated repository management
- CI/CD integration
- Scheduled analysis
- Event-driven workflows

#### 4. **Limited Output Handling**
- Stdout only (markdown rendered to terminal)
- No structured output formats (beyond `--raw`)
- No integration with external systems
- No persistence of results

**Impact**: AI output must be manually processed and actioned.

#### 5. **No Multi-User Support**
- Personal tool (not team collaboration)
- No access control
- No audit trail
- No shared state

**Impact**: Cannot be used for team workflows or shared automation.

---

### gh-aw Weaknesses

#### 1. **Complexity**
- Requires understanding of GitHub Actions
- Frontmatter has 20+ possible fields
- MCP server configuration is complex
- Compilation step required

**Example**:
```yaml
---
description: Simple issue responder
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
engine: copilot
tools:
  github:
    mode: remote
    toolsets: [issues]
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
strict: true
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults
---
```

**Impact**: Requires understanding frontmatter, safe outputs, and GitHub Actions for basic automation.

#### 2. **GitHub-Only**
- Cannot run outside GitHub Actions
- No local development workflow
- Tight coupling to GitHub ecosystem
- Requires repository for testing

**Impact**: Development cycle includes:
1. Edit workflow
2. Commit and push
3. Wait for GitHub Actions
4. Check logs
5. Repeat

**Slowdown**: Minutes per iteration vs seconds for mdflow.

#### 3. **Limited Template System**
- GitHub Actions expressions only
- No loops (`{% for %}`)
- No conditionals in prompt (`{% if %}`)
- No template variables (only GitHub context)

**Impact**: Less dynamic prompt generation, more duplication.

#### 4. **Rigid Import System**
```yaml
---
imports:
  - path/to/file.md  # Must exist at compile time
---
```

**Limitations**:
- No glob patterns
- No line ranges
- No symbol extraction
- No URL imports
- No command execution

**Impact**: Less flexible context gathering.

#### 5. **No Interactive Mode**
- All workflows run fully automated
- No human-in-the-loop for approval
- Cannot pause for user input
- Single-shot execution only

**Impact**: Not suitable for:
- Debugging with AI assistance
- Exploratory workflows
- User-guided automation

**Note**: Manual approval gates exist, but not true interactive AI sessions.

## Part 4: Cross-Pollination Opportunities

### From mdflow to gh-aw

#### 1. **Simplified Workflow Templates**
Create "mdflow-style" templates for gh-aw:

```bash
gh aw init review --style mdflow
```

Generates:
```yaml
---
description: Code review workflow
on: pull_request
engine: copilot
tools:
  github: { toolsets: [repos, pull_requests] }
  bash: ["gh pr diff"]
---
Review the code changes in this PR for:
- Bugs and potential issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code quality

# Files are automatically included via GitHub context
```

#### 2. **Import System Overhaul**
Adopt mdflow's import patterns:

**Current**:
```yaml
imports: [file1.md, file2.md]
```

**Proposed**:
```yaml
imports:
  glob:
    - pattern: "docs/**/*.md"
      recursive: true
  files:
    - path: "README.md"
      lines: [1, 50]
  symbols:
    - file: "src/types.go"
      symbols: [UserConfig, WorkflowData]
  commands:
    - cmd: "gh issue list --json number,title"
      cache: 5m
```

Implementation in `pkg/workflow/imports.go`:
- Add `GlobImport`, `LineRangeImport`, `SymbolImport`, `CommandImport` types
- Security: Restrict commands to safe list in strict mode
- Cache command output during compilation

#### 3. **Template Variable System**
Add LiquidJS-style template variables:

```yaml
---
vars:
  project_name: "Auth Module"
  target_version: "v2.0"
---
Analyze {{ project_name }} for upgrade to {{ target_version }}.

{% if env.DEBUG == "true" %}
Enable verbose logging.
{% endif %}
```

Implementation:
- Pre-process markdown before compilation
- Use `text/template` (Go) or embed LiquidJS
- Support GitHub expressions alongside template vars

#### 4. **Local Execution Mode**
Add `gh aw run-local` command:

```bash
gh aw run-local workflow.md --staged --dry-run
```

**Features**:
- Execute workflow locally with Docker
- Staged mode safety restrictions
- Simulate GitHub context (mocked events)
- Fast iteration without pushing to GitHub

#### 5. **Interactive Debugging**
Support interactive workflows via `workflow_dispatch`:

```yaml
---
mode: interactive
on: workflow_dispatch
inputs:
  issue_number:
    type: number
---
Debug issue #${{ inputs.issue_number }} interactively.
```

**Implementation**:
- Generate workflow with manual approval steps
- Use GitHub CLI for interaction
- State persistence between steps
- Resume from previous step

---

### From gh-aw to mdflow

#### 1. **Validation Mode**
Add `--validate` flag to mdflow:

```bash
mdflow task.claude.md --validate
```

**Checks**:
- Frontmatter keys match command flags
- Model names are valid
- Files in imports exist
- Commands in `!` expressions are available

#### 2. **Safe Output Mode**
Support structured output:

```yaml
---
safe-outputs:
  github-issue:
    title: "..."
    body: "..."
---
```

**Implementation**:
- Parse `safe-outputs` frontmatter
- Generate GitHub API calls using `gh` CLI
- Validate output before submission

#### 3. **Strict Mode**
Add security restrictions:

```yaml
---
strict: true
---
```

**Enforces**:
- No dangerous commands (rm, dd, etc.)
- No write access to system directories
- No network access without explicit permission
- User approval before executing AI-generated commands

#### 4. **MCP Server Integration**
Use gh-aw's MCP configuration format:

```yaml
---
tools:
  custom-mcp:
    mcp:
      type: stdio
      command: npx
      args: [-y, "@org/mcp-server"]
---
```

**Benefit**: Share MCP server configurations between mdflow and gh-aw.

#### 5. **Workflow Compilation**
Add `mdflow compile` command:

```bash
mdflow compile task.claude.md --output github-actions.yml
```

**Generates**: GitHub Actions workflow from mdflow markdown.

**Benefit**: Migration path from local mdflow tasks to gh-aw workflows.

---

## Part 5: Strategic Recommendations for gh-aw

### Short-Term (1-3 months)

#### 1. **Simplified Quickstart Templates**
- Create `gh aw init` with curated templates
- mdflow-inspired minimal syntax option
- Reduce boilerplate for common use cases

**Example**:
```bash
gh aw init issue-responder
gh aw init pr-reviewer --basic
gh aw init daily-report --template mdflow
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Import System**
- Add glob pattern support
- Implement line range imports
- Support URL imports (from GitHub only initially)

**Priority**: High (reduces manual file path specification and enables pattern-based imports)

#### 3. **Local Development Mode**
- Add `gh aw run-local` command
- Docker-based local execution
- Simulated GitHub context

**Benefit**: Faster development cycle, testing before deployment.

#### 4. **Better Error Messages**
- Learn from mdflow's simplicity
- Show "did you mean?" suggestions
- Explain validation failures with specific error codes and context

**Example**:
```
Error: Unknown field 'tool' in frontmatter
Did you mean: 'tools'?

Available fields:
  - tools: Configure AI tools
  - engine: Select AI engine
  - permissions: Set GitHub permissions
```

---

### Medium-Term (3-6 months)

#### 1. **Template Variable System**
- Add `vars:` section to frontmatter
- Support conditionals and loops
- Pre-process before compilation

**Use Case**: Dynamic prompts based on environment, inputs, or context.

#### 2. **Custom Engine: mdflow-local**
- Implement mdflow-style engine for gh-aw
- Support local execution with mdflow syntax
- Bridge between mdflow and gh-aw

**Benefit**: Migration path for mdflow users.

#### 3. **Interactive Workflow Mode**
- Support multi-turn AI conversations
- Manual approval between steps
- State persistence

**Use Case**: Debugging, exploratory analysis, human-in-the-loop.

#### 4. **Command Import Support**
- Execute commands during compilation
- Cache output
- Security: Staged mode only

**Example**:
```yaml
imports:
  commands:
    - gh issue list --json number,title
    - git log --oneline -10
```

---

### Long-Term (6-12 months)

#### 1. **Hybrid Execution Model**
- Local execution for development
- GitHub Actions for production
- Shared workflow definition

**Architecture**:
```
workflow.md
  ↓
gh aw compile
  ↓
├─→ local-runner (Docker)    # Development
└─→ .lock.yml (GitHub Actions) # Production
```

#### 2. **Enhanced MCP Ecosystem**
- MCP server registry
- Registry-based discovery and installation
- Shared configurations

**Inspiration**: mdflow's MCP server patterns.

#### 3. **Workflow Composition**
- Reusable workflow fragments
- Composable modules
- Shared prompt libraries

**Example**:
```yaml
---
imports:
  workflows:
    - github://org/workflow-library/prompts/code-review.md
    - github://org/workflow-library/tools/security-scan.md
---
```

#### 4. **Visual Workflow Builder**
- Web UI for workflow creation
- Drag-and-drop tool configuration
- Generate markdown from UI

**Benefit**: Lower barrier to entry, visual debugging.

---

## Part 6: Custom Engine Implementation Guide

### Engine 1: mdflow-compat (Compatibility Layer)

**Purpose**: Run mdflow-style workflows in gh-aw with safety guarantees.

#### Architecture

```go
// pkg/workflow/mdflow_compat_engine.go

type MdflowCompatEngine struct {
    BaseEngine
}

func NewMdflowCompatEngine() *MdflowCompatEngine {
    return &MdflowCompatEngine{
        BaseEngine: BaseEngine{
            id:                     "mdflow-compat",
            displayName:            "mdflow Compatibility",
            description:            "Run mdflow-style workflows with gh-aw safety",
            experimental:           true,
            supportsToolsAllowlist: true,
            supportsHTTPTransport:  false,
            supportsMaxTurns:       true,
            supportsWebFetch:       false,
            supportsWebSearch:      false,
        },
    }
}
```

#### Frontmatter Translation

```yaml
# mdflow style
---
model: opus
print: true
mcp-config: ./mcp.json
add-dir: [./src, ./tests]
_feature_name: Authentication
---
```

Translates to:
```yaml
# gh-aw internal
---
engine: mdflow-compat
engine:
  command: claude
  args: ["--model", "opus", "--print"]
  env:
    MCP_CONFIG: /tmp/gh-aw/mcp-config.json
vars:
  feature_name: Authentication
tools:
  bash: ["ls -la ./src", "ls -la ./tests"]
---
```

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Create engine file**: `pkg/workflow/mdflow_compat_engine.go`
2. **Implement frontmatter parser**: Convert mdflow → gh-aw format
3. **Add template processor**: LiquidJS compatibility
4. **Register engine**: Add to `NewEngineRegistry()`
5. **Add tests**: `pkg/workflow/mdflow_compat_engine_test.go`

#### Security Considerations

- **Staged mode only**: Never allow in production
- **Command validation**: Allowlist for `add-dir` style flags
- **MCP server restrictions**: Only stdio, no HTTP
- **Template sanitization**: Prevent injection via variables

---

### Engine 2: local-dev (Local Development Engine)

**Purpose**: Fast iteration during workflow development with full local execution.

#### Architecture

```yaml
---
engine: local-dev
engine:
  ai-command: claude  # or copilot, codex
  mode: interactive   # or print
tools:
  filesystem: read-write
  bash: ["*"]  # All commands (with confirmation)
  network: unrestricted
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:  # Simulated locally
---
```

#### Features

1. **Local Execution**: Runs in Docker on developer machine
2. **GitHub Simulation**: Mock `${{ github.* }}` context
3. **Fast Feedback**: No push/wait/check cycle
4. **Debug Mode**: Pause execution, inspect state
5. **Safe-Output Preview**: Show what would be created

#### Implementation

```go
// pkg/workflow/local_dev_engine.go

func (e *LocalDevEngine) GetExecutionSteps(workflowData *WorkflowData, logFile string) []GitHubActionStep {
    steps := []GitHubActionStep{
        {
            Name: "Local Development Mode",
            Run: `#!/bin/bash
echo "⚠️  Running in local development mode"
echo "This workflow will execute with full system access"
echo "Safe-outputs will be simulated (not actually created)"
`,
        },
        {
            Name: "Execute AI Command",
            Run: fmt.Sprintf("%s --interactive < /tmp/gh-aw/prompt.txt", e.aiCommand),
            Env: map[string]string{
                "GH_AW_LOCAL_MODE": "true",
                "GH_AW_SIMULATE_GITHUB_CONTEXT": "true",
            },
        },
    }
    return steps
}
```

#### Usage

```bash
# Develop workflow locally
gh aw run-local workflow.md --engine local-dev

# Preview safe-outputs
gh aw run-local workflow.md --preview-outputs

# Interactive debugging
gh aw run-local workflow.md --debug --step-by-step
```

---

### Engine 3: template-expander (Enhanced Templating Engine)

**Purpose**: Provide advanced template features beyond GitHub Actions expressions.

#### Features

```yaml
---
engine: template-expander
vars:
  projects: [auth, billing, analytics]
  environments: [dev, staging, prod]
---
{% for project in projects %}
## {{ project | capitalize }}

Analyze the {{ project }} module for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code quality

{% if project == "auth" %}
Special focus on authentication flows and JWT handling.
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}

{% for env in environments %}
Deploy to {{ env }} environment after verification.
{% endfor %}
```

#### Implementation

**Template Processor**:
```go
// pkg/workflow/template_processor.go

import "text/template"

func ProcessTemplateVariables(markdown string, vars map[string]any) (string, error) {
    tmpl, err := template.New("workflow").Parse(markdown)
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to parse template: %w", err)
    }
    
    var buf bytes.Buffer
    if err := tmpl.Execute(&buf, vars); err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to execute template: %w", err)
    }
    
    return buf.String(), nil
}
```

**Engine Integration**:
```go
func (e *TemplateExpanderEngine) PreprocessPrompt(workflowData *WorkflowData) (string, error) {
    if workflowData.Vars == nil {
        return workflowData.Prompt, nil
    }
    
    expanded, err := ProcessTemplateVariables(workflowData.Prompt, workflowData.Vars)
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("template expansion failed: %w", err)
    }
    
    return expanded, nil
}
```

## Part 7: Performance and Scale Comparison

### mdflow Performance

**Strengths**:
- Cold start: ~50-100ms (Bun runtime)
- Warm start: ~10-20ms (cached context)
- Context gathering: Parallel file reading
- Incremental parsing: Only parse what's needed

**Architecture**:
- LRU cache for file descriptions (200 entries)
- Lazy-loading of heavy dependencies (file selector, history)
- Optimized for CLI responsiveness

**Benchmark** (from code inspection):
```typescript
// src/cache.ts - LRU cache implementation
class LRUCache<K, V> {
  private cache = new Map<K, V>();
  private maxSize: number;
  
  get(key: K): V | undefined {
    // O(1) lookup
    const value = this.cache.get(key);
    if (value !== undefined) {
      // Move to end (most recently used)
      this.cache.delete(key);
      this.cache.set(key, value);

## Part 9: Security Model Comparison

### mdflow Security

**Model**: Trust-based, user responsibility

**Assumptions**:
1. User reviews markdown before execution
2. User trusts the command they're running
3. Local execution limits blast radius
4. User has control to interrupt (Ctrl+C)

**Protections**:
- None by default
- `dangerously-skip-permissions` flag (opt-out of prompts)
- Process manager for graceful shutdown

**Risk Profile**:
- High: Full system access
- Local: Damage limited to user's machine
- Manual: User initiates each execution

**Suitable For**:
- Personal productivity tools
- Trusted environment
- Developer's own machine
- Ad-hoc tasks

---

### gh-aw Security

**Model**: Zero-trust, security-first

**Assumptions**:
1. Workflows may be written by untrusted users
2. AI can make mistakes or be malicious
3. Workflows run in shared infrastructure
4. Damage must be contained and auditable

**Protections** (Multi-layered):

1. **Compile-Time**:
   - Schema validation
   - Permission checking
   - Tool allowlist verification
   - Template injection prevention

2. **Runtime**:
   - Docker sandboxing
   - Network firewall (deny-by-default)
   - Read-only filesystem (except /tmp)
   - Safe-outputs for write operations

3. **Supply Chain**:
   - Action SHA pinning
   - MCP server image verification
   - Dependency scanning

4. **Audit**:
   - Complete execution logs
   - GitHub Actions UI tracking
   - Permissions recorded
   - Output sanitization logs

**Risk Profile**:
- Low: Minimal damage possible
- Shared: Runs in isolated containers
- Automated: Triggered by events
- Auditable: Complete history

**Suitable For**:
- Team workflows
- Repository automation
- CI/CD pipelines
- Untrusted workflow execution

## Conclusion and Recommendations

### Key Takeaways

1. **mdflow excels at**: Personal productivity, local tasks, basic workflows, fast iteration
2. **gh-aw excels at**: Team automation, CI/CD, security, GitHub integration, structured output
3. **They serve different needs**: mdflow = developer tool, gh-aw = platform tool
4. **Both approaches offer insights**: Each implements patterns that address specific use cases

### Top 3 Recommendations for gh-aw

#### 1. **Simplified Quickstart Experience** (Inspired by mdflow)
- Create "basic mode" templates that hide complexity
- Add `gh aw init --template mdflow-style` for familiar syntax
- Provide sensible defaults that work out-of-the-box

**Impact**: Lower barrier to entry, faster adoption

#### 2. **Enhanced Import System** (Adopt mdflow patterns)
- Implement glob pattern imports
- Add line range support
- Enable URL imports (GitHub only initially)
- Support command execution (staged mode)

**Impact**: Reduces manual file specification, enables pattern-based context gathering

#### 3. **Local Development Workflow** (Hybrid approach)
- Add `gh aw run-local` command for Docker-based local execution
- Simulate GitHub context for testing
- Fast feedback loop (seconds instead of minutes)

**Impact**: Reduces workflow iteration time from minutes to seconds

### Opportunity: mdflow-to-gh-aw Bridge

**Concept**: Create a migration tool and compatibility layer.

```bash
# Convert mdflow workflow to gh-aw
gh aw migrate mdflow review.claude.md --output review-workflow.md

# Run mdflow-style workflow in gh-aw
gh aw compile --engine mdflow-compat review.claude.md
```

**Benefits**:
- Provide migration path for mdflow users
- Leverage mdflow's simplicity in gh-aw context
- Enable gradual adoption (start with minimal features, add security later)

### Final Thoughts

mdflow and gh-aw represent two philosophies of AI workflow automation:
- **mdflow**: "Move fast, trust the user, maximize flexibility"
- **gh-aw**: "Move carefully, verify everything, maximize safety"

Neither is "superior"—they're optimized for different contexts. The opportunity for gh-aw is to learn from mdflow's simplicity and developer experience while maintaining its security guarantees. By adopting mdflow's proven patterns (templates, imports, fast iteration) and wrapping them in gh-aw's safety model, we can combine their strengths.
